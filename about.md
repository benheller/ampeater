## What Is This Place? Who Are You? What Have You Done With My Wallet?
Ampeater Music is a web­site devoted to bridg­ing the gap between unsigned (or just plain under­ex­posed) artists and music lovers every­where. Every day we fea­ture a dif­fer­ent artist on what we call The Ampeater Review. Each fea­tured artist sub­mits a "dig­i­tal 7-inch" which we then com­ple­ment with a detailed review and offer as a free down­load. Our mis­sion is to help music lovers every­where con­nect with new artists, and in turn help artists reach out to new listeners.

## What is a dig­i­tal 7-inch?
A dig­i­tal 7-inch is essen­tially a pro­mo­tional sin­gle. like the clas­sic vinyl 7-inch format, an ampeater dig­i­tal 7-inch includes two songs–an A-Side and a B-Side. The artist may choose both songs, but we encour­age artists to come out strong with an A-Side designed to hook new lis­ten­ers and a B-Side crafted for some­one a bit more adven­tur­ous. The tracks can be stu­dio record­ings, demos, or live tracks — new or released.

## Nice Things
> The Ampeater Review is a new blog/record label that fea­tures free down­loads of “dig­i­tal 7-inches” from unsigned bands every week­day. Designed as a means for pro­mot­ing fledg­ling artists, the site is a ver­i­ta­ble gold­mine for adven­tur­ous music lovers look­ing for some­thing new, as well as a much needed out­let for bands in search of expo­sure.

> I truly believe in what this site is doing, bring­ing back the heart and warmth, care and atten­tion to the cold cyn­i­cal blo­gos­phere. In depth reviews from peo­ple who truly care and think about their music for peo­ple who feel the same.
