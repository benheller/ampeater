title: Ampeater Music
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Ampeater Music is a web­site devoted to bridg­ing the gap between unsigned 
  (or just plain under­ex­posed) artists and music lovers every­where. Every day we 
  fea­ture a dif­fer­ent artist on what we call The Ampeater Review. Each fea­tured 
  artist sub­mits a "dig­i­tal 7-inch" which we then com­ple­ment with a detailed 
  review and offer as a free down­load. Our mis­sion is to help music lovers 
  every­where con­nect with new artists, and in turn help artists reach out to 
  new listeners.
