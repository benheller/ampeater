We love getting mail. It's amazing to open something up with your hands and put it on a turntable or CD player. We don't do that often enough anymore. Ampeater darlings **Plume Giant** sent us a pre-release copy of their album _Callithump_, scheduled for release on August 28th. While we can't blow the big surprise by leaking the music, we can tell you that they'll be ushering in the new record with a [show at Mercury Lounge on August 31st](http://www.mercuryloungenyc.com/event/142541/). If you've seen the videos from their [Sprague Hall sessions,](http://ampeatermusic.com/plume-giant-the-sprague-hall-sessions-complete-audio) you'd be remiss to let this one slide by. Plus, we've heard the new album and it's just ridiculously good.
