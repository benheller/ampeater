The Ampeater Launch Party was a resounding success, and we owe a great big thanks to all the artists who put on incredible shows and the fans who made it out on a Tuesday night to have their asses thoroughly rocked. For those of you who didn't or couldn't come (shame on you!) it was a seriously awesome evening, and we kept Pianos packed to the brim for hours. We didn't manage to document every second of the event, but we're lucky enough to have this kickass photo of **Amazing/Wow** and _full sets_ from **Weyes Bluhd** and **RAUL**. Check it out!<!-- more -->
