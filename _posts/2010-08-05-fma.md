[](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Ampeater_Music/FMA_Compilation/)That's right kids, Ampeater's now in league with WFMU's [Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/label/ampeatermusic/), a repository of high quality mp3s that are available free for download. We're working with the FMA to get our entire back catalog up on their site, and from this point forward all Ampeater digital 7-inches will be automatically published to the FMA. This is a big step forward in our mission to help underexposed artists, and we're thrilled at the opportunity to spread the music featured on this site to an even greater audience. As a celebration of this glorious union, we've released a special compilation for WFMU. The tracks were selected by the FMA's [Jason Sigal](http://freemusicarchive.org/member/jason) in conjunction with Ben Heller at Ampeater. The whole album's embedded below for easy listening, but you can also [visit its FMA page](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Ampeater_Music/FMA_Compilation/) for more information. Enjoy!
