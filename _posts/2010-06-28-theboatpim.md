![](http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Pattern-is-Movement.jpeg "Pattern is Movement") Well this is pretty cool: music on a boat. Yes, like the SNL short, but with less autotune. We're pretty stoked to see how this turns out. I mean, it's a boat, right? Sweet. Hometapes artist Pattern is Movement kicks off the season with Glass Ghost in support.
