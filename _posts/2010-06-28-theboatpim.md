Well this is pretty cool: music on a boat. Yes, like the SNL short, but with less autotune. We're pretty stoked to see how this turns out. I mean, it's a boat, right? Sweet. Hometapes artist Pattern is Movement kicks off the season with Glass Ghost in support.

The BOAT embarks from Pier 40 (Houston Street and West Side Highway) aboard the ship Star of Palm Beach, and throws 2 shows each night at 7pm and 10pm. You pick the time. Enter to win below!
