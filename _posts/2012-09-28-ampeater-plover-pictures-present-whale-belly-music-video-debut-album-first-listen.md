Our amazing pals Whale Belly ([AEM127](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem127)) have teamed up with the talented dudes at Plover Pictures to bring you a brand spanking new music video. It's clever, it's artistic, it looks great, and we're showing it at Banter on October 5th. Plus, you'll get to hear the brand new Whale Belly album "I Was Once A Bird" played all the way through! It'll be a grand old time--Whale Belly even promises to play a couple tunes, and there'll be FREE PIZZA!

Details can be had at the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/359627560788197/). Come and join us!
