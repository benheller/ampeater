![](http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/glines-300x199.jpg "Michael Glines")Few can write songs like **Michael Glines**. Fewer still have the vocal dynamo to perform them. Those who've got both belong to a rare breed. The determined listener may spend years staggering from coffee house to dive bar, politely stomaching innumerable watered-down one-drink-minimums over comparably watered-down performances in search of one of these elusive artists in its natural habitat-pristine obscurity, untainted by modern ills like inflated ego, commercial aspiration, and mainstream press. We dream. We console ourselves with the blind hope that such an artist must exist somewhere out there and believe that, when we find it, we'll recognize it at once.

I met **Michael Glines** almost two years ago. Through mutual friends, he wound up sitting in with my street jazz band during one of our weekly all-night jams in Hongdae, the vibrant and usually shit-faced epicenter of Seoul's music and party scene. He arrived with just a violin, an instrument he'd just begun to learn, and spent most of the night on the fringes of our makeshift stage. The few notes he played were buried behind the clamor of drums, amplified guitars, automobiles, and the thick dance grooves that wafted up from the bowls of all the clubs on the block. In short, it took me a while to recognize Glines as a member of that rare breed of superlative artist. Near dawn, when the rest of the band had laid down our instruments and diverted our attention to the beers we'd been nursing or striking up conversations with some cute girl in the audience, I noticed Glines, perhaps on request of one such cute girl, break into an original composition. Strumming his violin (since he hadn't brought a guitar) and shouting the words to a composition he'd just written (in a language he'd just learned) into the neon night, the performer seized my complete attention. The crowd looked on in passive approval but I felt that I was witnessing something special.

Over the next months, I became better acquainted with Glines. We met a couple of times to share and critique original compositions. What Glines had mastered was drama. His compositions all spiraled into lush dissonances, propped up by confident vocals which he could bend or sustain as much as needed.

Since then, Glines has returned to his native Califorina, where he's just released a stunning EP, which he's generously agreed to share with the Ampeater community. We plan to feature two of these tracks in an upcoming 7" , but felt that the music was too good to keep to ourselves until then, so here it is:

Glines will spend the next few weeks in New York, with a couple of solo performances scheduled.
