When we [last wrote about Zeb Gould in April](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem132), we gave him some pretty high praise: _"Gould's music has uni ­ver ­sal appeal. That's not to say that it's uni ­ver ­sally liked, but rather that it's uni ­ver ­sally lik ­able. There's some ­thing about it that wholly tran ­scends its roots in Amer ­i ­can tra ­di ­tional gen ­res and com ­mu ­ni ­cates suc ­cess ­fully in a lan ­guage that need not be trans ­lated into any other for one to imme ­di ­ately grasp its poignant and beau ­ti ­ful essence."_ And you know what? Six months later we still feel the same way. That's why we're thrilled to introduce Zeb Gould's new album "Forget The Great Heart," available now through the [Ampeater Music Store](http://ampeatermusic.com/store/downloads/forget-the-great-heart) and [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/forget-the-great-heart/id473325426).
