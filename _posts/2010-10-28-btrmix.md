We're psyched to announce that **BreakThru Radio** has featured Ampeater on their _"Anatomy of a Blogger"_ program, hosted by Thompson Davis. The program includes an interview with Ampeater co-founder Ben Heller and a killer mixtape of 7-inch tracks. You can listen to the original broadcast over at BTR by clicking [here](http://www.breakthruradio.com/index.php?show=11828).

We've also put the Compilation up for streaming and download on [WFMU's Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Ampeater_Music/BreakThru_Radio_Ampeater_Compilation/).
