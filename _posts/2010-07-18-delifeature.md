Apparently the Deli Magazine's caught onto what we're doing here at Ampeater, and they like it. This is the kinda thing that puts bounce in our step, and smiles on our partially bearded faces. Like Dr. Scholl's, or Vampire Weekend getting sued for $2 million. We're pumped, so thanks Deli Mag! You can download and read the whole issue in PDF [here](http://66.147.225.17/deli-pdf/23.pdf). We're on page 11.
