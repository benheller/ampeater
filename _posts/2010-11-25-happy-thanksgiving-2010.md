We're thrilled beyond words to still be alive and kicking for our second Thanksgiving. Like last year, the Ampeater family will be waking up at 4am on Thanksgiving morn to get the turkey and stuffing cooking, while Gabe serenades the group with an acoustic rendition of ["City Kids"](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem105). That is, until noon, when the annual "Alice's Restaurant" singalong gets under way. We hope you'll join in, and celebrate the only Thanksgiving music worth celebrating (that is, unless you count the artist known as [Thanksgiving](http://www.marriagerecs.com/thanksgiving), who has a reasonable claim to this title). In any case, wherever you are, eat some grub, drink some beer, and pass the fuck out. That's what we'll be doing. See you next week!
