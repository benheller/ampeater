So here's the deal: We've got 50 of these little yellow cards, courtesy of Rolling Stone Magazine, that let us give _anyone_ we want a **FREE** subscription (that's 12 issues). You readers are the closest thing we've got to friends, so we thought we'd offer them up to you. Now, I know Rolling Stone's no Ampeater, but please be kind to them, they've been around for a long time and they get cranky when they haven't had their nap. That's it! Fill out the form below with the necessary information, and we'll mail the subscription card. Magazines will magically start showing up at your house! It's even a great Holiday gift for a friend, if you have any of those.

SOLD OUT!
