Like a good parent, Ampeater loves each and every one of our digital 7-inches equally. Officially, that is. Behind closed doors, there's a handful of artists we take home with us--they live on our iPods and in our car stereos. They know our personal Gmail addresses and together we've listened, hand in hand, to gentle folk ballads about Goatse. These are the privileged few, and we'd bend over backwards to see their records top the charts. If you've been paying any attention to Ampeater over the last few years, you might have noticed that Uncles is one of the elect. They first appeared with a digital 7-inch on [AEM092](/aem092), then returned will a full stream of their last album "Replacing Words With Other Words". We brought them into the studio for a [Casual Business session](/casualbusiness03) and included them on our first [Concrete Experience mixtape](ce01). We're now proud to offer their latest and greatest LP as a free stream.<!-- more -->
