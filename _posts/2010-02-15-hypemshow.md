Hey everybody! A while back our friends at the [Hype Machine](http://hypem.com) asked us to help curate a special show at [Housing Works in Soho, NYC](http://www.housingworks.org/social-enterprise/bookstore-cafe/). They had an idea for an event that would be part show and part CD swap (with all proceeds going to support Housing Works), and thought we might have good recommendations as to some under-hyped bands. We settled on [Shark?](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem018) and [Cuddle Magic](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem021), and Hypem brought The Morning Benders in to close--it's gonna be a great, great show. Come on out, support Housing Works, support some local bands, and have a good time! ![Hypem Show](http://blog.hypem.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/housingworks225.jpg)
