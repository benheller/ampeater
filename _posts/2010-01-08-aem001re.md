Hey there, remember our very first review? Well, way way back in 2009 we started this whole thing off with **Strawberry Hands**. You can read the review and listen to Side B from the 7-inch at [ampeatermusic.com/aem001](http://www.ampeatermusic.com/aem001). We're sad to say that Side A is no longer with us, having suffered a tragic demise at the hands of its own creator. That said, we're not about to cut our catalog one song short without doing something cool to compensate. After all, these songs are like family to us. So, we present you with a new 7-inch from Strawberry Hands, sans review, as a bit of a teaser. These tracks are both from the magnificent album **Palaces Upon Palaces**, which can be had via our [store page](http://www.ampeatermusic.com/store) for ten bucks.<!-- more -->
