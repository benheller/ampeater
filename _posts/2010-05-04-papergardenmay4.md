Every once in a while, a label comes along that's so good it's untouchable in its musical discretion. Paper Garden Records is that label. With artists like Peasant, SAADI, and Emanuel & The Fear, Paper Garden's bringing such incredible music into this world that we can't help but give it a digital salute. If you live within 500 miles of New York City, Tuesday's Paper Garden showcase at Death By Audio is a moral imperative. You can look forward to sets by [Pet Ghost Project](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem007), Alcoholic Faith Mission, Hymns, [SAADI](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem067), [Peasant](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem071), and The City and Horses. I'll be there, and you should come too. It's a benefit for Showpaper, so it's a pay-what-you-can kinda deal ($7-$25) and admission's going to a worthy cause. That said, we're giving away 2 pairs of tickets to the show, so who's gonna get 'em?
