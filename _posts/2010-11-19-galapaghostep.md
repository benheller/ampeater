![](http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Galapaghost-Runnin-Cover-Art-for-tunecore-1024x768.jpg "Galapaghost - Runnin'") Casey Chandler aka [Galapaghost (AEM078)](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem078) has just released his latest EP entitled Runnin' which includes seven spankin' new tracks that he's generously agreed to give away for free on Ampeater. As in many of his previous recordings, Chandler dresses depressing lyrics in ironically upbeat chord progressions, peppy rhythms, and a whole lotta ukulele. However, Runnin' also marks a significant step forward for Chandler. The experimental and concise songwriting featured throughout the EP demonstrates newfound artistic maturity for this bard of the "lost generation", as he likes to call it, and the production is considerably more polished than on his past releases. "The Demise of Me" and title-track "Runnin'" make for the most obvious hit singles since they're so damn catchy. The rest of the cuts are bit darker and mellower, but seem bound to tug at the heartstrings of anyone who gives them a thorough listen. By the way, did we mention that it's all completely free?
