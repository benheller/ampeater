Over the last year, we've received many 7-inch requests from artists we've already featured. It's always been our mission to help introduce our readers to new music, so we've been hesitant to double up on artists. Plus, our original reviews are generally so exhaustive that there's usually not much more we can say about a band without beginning to repeat ourselves, or resorting to childhood anecdotes. But, we do love the artists that we feature, and we'd like to continue to help get the word out about their music, long after the original 7-inch review's been buried in the archives. So, we've come up with this: a **Follow-Up 7-inch Series**. We invite any artist that's received a previous review to get back in touch and hit us up with two new tracks. We'll do a shorter write-up, basically updating everyone on any new artistic developments, tours, etc., and giving some context to the new tunes. We'll also link back to the original review, and give it a chance to reach some new listeners. Sound good? Head on over to the [Ampeater Submit page](http://ampeatermusic.com/submit) and send us some music!
