**Weyes Bluhd** is good enough to inspire elaborate suicidal fantasies. That may seem like ridiculous blog hyperbole, but for a brief moment in the summer of 2006, it was truer than true. It was my first summer as a college student. I was living in a tiny but expensive walk-up in the LES, spiritually vacant and utterly depressed, making frequent trips to visit my girlfriend in Philadelphia where a small, committed group of artists were turning me on to the rich possibilities of DIY. There were a lot of great bands playing an endless variety of venues, but for my money, the cream of the crop was a young girl from Doylestown, PA (~45 minutes North of Philly) by the name of **Natalie Mering**.

On the Philly circuit, she was known as **Wiseblood**. Playing intimate, mostly house-set shows with the constantly evolving crew of Dark Juices (Jim Strong of Wrinkle, Floating Market; Jordan Burgis of The Furniture, Quantum Spine Recordings; many others), **Mering** thoroughly stoked the Philadelphia community. At that time, her music was a slab of melancholy folk with goosebump-inducing, butter-voiced melodies adorned by the Dark Juices' mysterious amalgam of tape-collage, sonorous metallic objects and other unusual textures. In short, it killed, and it was the most beautiful music I'd ever heard in my 19 years on Earth (stick _that_ in your hyperbole pipe). So much so, in fact, that after a performance at the now-defunct Haunted Cream Egg, I approached Mering with these words: _"One day, I want you to be singing to me with a knife between your feet, cutting my throat as I die by your song."_ Melodramatic, I know. I meant every word.

Fast forward to 2009. A lot has happened since for **Mering** since then. After a stint in Portland that included music classes at Lewis and Clark college and falling in with the excellent Americana-cum-psychedelic free-improv band Jackie O-Motherfucker (whose 2000 release **Fig. 5** deserves a serious listen), she returned to the Philadelphia area to continue performing and recording. 2007 saw the self-release of her debut full-length, the intriguing **Strange Chalices of Seeing**. Though the record contains Mering's trademark pipes, they're often matched, if not obscured, by infinite layers of mystery noise. Sometimes they're not present at all, as in the case of **"Remote Beach at Avernus รก Stretched Out Staircase,"** which begins as a Paleolithic drum circle under Angus Maclise-like oscillation freakouts and then transitions, with the elegantly abrupt whir of a tape-splice, into unsettlingly cavernous drone territory.

It's an exercise in willfully obscure textures, sound for the sake of mystery and pleasure, a scarily focused mystical text that makes you grit your teeth at the sight of _"Lo-Fi."_ Sure, this isn't high-production studio wizardry (it'd be abandoning its DIY ethic if it were), but it's no cheap gimmick either. It's fidelity being used self-consciously, not just as a means of representation (i.e. trying to maintain fidelity to the sound of the original source) but rather as a source of abstract expression (i.e. obscuring the original source in novel ways to produce new, more meaningful textures-_"a splinter in the eye is the best magnifying glass"_ ). It's the moment when the painter stops using paint to represent a nude woman 'realistically' and throws paint on the canvas to express the violence subtending her appeal. This is the moment when **Wiseblood** was reincarnated as **Weyes Bluhd**\-when gorgeous gothic hymns were misspelled as acid-drenched landscapes with a menacing, subliminal center.

Which brings us to the **"Shattered Mirror"/"Liquor Castle" 7-inch**. **"Shattered Mirror"** marks an interesting development in the Weyes Bluhd catalogue. Not as pretty as some of the earliest ballads (which, as far as I know, have never been released), not as deranged as some of the material on **Strange Chalices of Seeing**, the track is a true balancing act of influences. I hear an acknowledgment of pop classics in the drumbeat, that classic Jesus and Mary Chain-by-way-of-The Ronettes stomp. But in typical **Weyes Bluhd** fashion, the familiar element is refracted through a prism of mystery. The result is a beat without a snare, the drum's familiar pop replaced by a ringing, bell-like sonority in some parts and a blood-curdling, trebly scrape in others. Even the pretty vocal melody is made more severe by an undercurrent of surrealistic spoken-word (_"time is like a mirror, counting the days and eyes"_ ). This sound certainly supports the closest thing to a musical manifesto I ever got from **Mering**: _"I want to play an ancient song, but through the sonic elements of tape collage and electronics, accidental sounds that rejuvenate the melodic archetype while also thrusting it into the future."_

The element of poetry is brought to the forefront in **"Liquor Castle,"** which begins with a long feedback-fu\*ked moan and continues through a hailstorm of harmonics guitar (a large board zither that isolates string timbre into individual harmonics, invented by NY-godhead and guitar-orchestra pioneer Glenn Branca) and occasionally decipherable words. I can't pretend to know what's happening in the language-scape-which is probably more than half the point-but it has its moments of weird narrative clarity (_"they asked me why I was drinking from up there, that's what they use to wash their floors up there"_ ). **Weyes Bluhd** has carved out a truly unique soundworld with these tracks. The closest reference point that I can think of is UK-underground stalwarts The Shadow Ring, whose wordsmith Graham Lambkin has performed alongside **Mering** and made an obvious impression on her musical vocabulary.

If these tracks are any indication, **Weyes Bluhd's** forthcoming LP will be a strong marriage of her across-the-spectrum influences, from straightforward songwriting to confusing noise of otherworldy timbre. As much as the Blood in **Natalie Mering's** moniker suggests love, longing and connection, it also signals violence of the psychedelic cult-horror variety. You may not want to die listening to this music, but you may not have a choice.
