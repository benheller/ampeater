Hi all--we don't usually chime in to report businessy type things, but this could actually impact what we do and how we do it. Ampeater's now a Guitar Center affiliate, which means they'll be advertising on our site, over yonder in the sidebar area. But most importantly, we get a kickback from them every time someone makes a sale using the links on our site. I know you guys all buy gear on Guitar Center's website from time to time, so in the future, think about us, and maybe make that purchase through Ampeater. It doesn't cost you anything extra, and it helps support what we do here. In case you're feeling inspired to buy something right now, here's an extra banner to get you on your way:
