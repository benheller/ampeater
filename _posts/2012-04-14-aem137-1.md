Last November, I reviewed **Del Bel**, a Toronto-based electro-acoustic indie collective led by multi-instrumentalist **Tyler Belluz**, defined by the memorable voice of **Lisa Conway**, and supported by some dozen talented musicians.

<!-- more -->

Those who enjoyed Del Bel the first time around will be happy to hear that the collective is about to release a remix album of **Oneiric**, the album from which the two previous tracks were drawn. When? Don't worry, you won't have to wait! The album will be released today at the **Kazoo! Festival** in Guelph, Ontario. Each remix was produced by a different DJ from Guelph in a different style in honor of the festival.

For those who can't bear to wait a few more hours, check out the streamable/downloadable remix of **"No Reservation."** You may remember the composition from [AEM137](http://ampeatermusic.com/aem137). To appreciate the remix, we recommend that you listen to both versions side-by-side. While the original is rooted around a heavy bass groove, the remix unfolds at a slower pace, leaving the listener in anticipation of that magic moment when the beat drops and the crowd goes wild.

The remix was produced by **Live Action Fezz**, a multimedia artist and designer best known as a member of the popular indie dance-rock band **Green Go**.

Those who want to hear more can purchase the full remix album through Del Bel's [Bandcamp page](http://delbel.bandcamp.com/album/kareemix-abdel-jabbel). In addition to the digital version, the collective is offering a 'semi-physical' version of the release with small versions of the poster attached [here](http://ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM137-1 Del Bel/Del Bel.jpg) (with the download code behind it), accompanied by a Kareem Abdul Jabbar basketball card.

Why Kareem Abdul Jabbar? Well, why not! He seems like a safer choice of basketball hero than Bill Lambeer, the legendary fouler commemorated in my recent review of Clear Plastic Masks.

Also, when you take a close look at the event poster, you'll notice that his name makes a nice allusion to remixes, Del Bel, and the Kazoo! Festival.
