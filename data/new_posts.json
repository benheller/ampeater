		"content" : "<em>Pop music is a bitch.</em>Â Once you start listening to it - and listening to it obsessively - it becomes inescapable: you can't listen to anything else. And among certain sensibilities, pop music is hotter than ever. We appreciate more experimental bandsÂ <em>when</em>Â they go pop; far from looking down on it, we treat pop as a virtue. While a lot of interesting stuff can come out of more left-field bands dabbling in pop, we also fetishize it, crowding out true experimentation. At least this reviewer did. Then a band comes along likeÂ <strong>Strawberry Hands</strong>Â that makes you think again about why you listen to music in the first place.\r\n\r\n<strong>Strawberry Hands</strong>, then, is not a pop band. They donâ€™t make music for you: they donâ€™t reach out and grab you by the lapels (or the cardigans, or whatever) and sayÂ <em>listen</em>. The duo that makes up the band,Â <strong>Jake Brunner</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Jim Strong</strong>, make music for themselves. And this is refreshing.\r\n\r\nTakeÂ <strong>\"The Prettiest Song in the World\"</strong>, side A of this 7-inch. Whisper quiet, almost burlesque sounding in its rhythm and harmony, with intersecting, cooing falsettos, the group has created a whole new kind of eeriness that is powerful in its quiet way. It is so creepy, in part, because of the conflicting tendencies they convey: on the one hand comforting and intimate, their music is also deeply anxious in a way thatâ€™s difficult to identify. You might call it a kind of resigned mourning. You get the sense that these guys should have laid down the soundtrack to one of those post-war European noirs, serving as the house band an empty salon that stubbornly refuses to close.\r\n\r\nThis is all my reaction to the music, of course, but perhaps my way of reacting to it is the whole point. Repetition â€“ a main theme ofÂ <strong>Strawberry Hands's</strong>Â work â€“ leads to hypnotic impressions.Â <strong>Brunner</strong>Â waxed philosophic to me in an email about this:\r\n\r\n<em>â€œBut even strict repetition is a kind of illusion. There are lots of composers that play with the idea of repetition and its inherent paradoxes. The thing about repetition in music is that people only think about the musical material, but they don't consider the interaction of human perception with that musical material. That's why something repeated many many times can take on a completely different character, like with Reich's early tape loops, or with Satie's Vexations which is a page of music played for like 8 hours.â€</em>\r\n\r\nClearly these guys have thought about their music. Even the texture of their sound is meticulously crafted. Though you might call the music lo-fi, this is really a misnomer: lo-fi implies some degradation of sound quality, whereas these guys deliberately morph their sound to their own tastes. It takes a little getting used to, but the warmth conveyed onÂ <strong>\"The Prettiest Song in the World\"</strong>Â has a lot to do with the texture they create, which sounds like an exaggerated version of the sound you get from vinyl.\r\n\r\nThe self-titled B-side to this record is equally as haunting as theÂ <strong>\"The Prettiest Song\"</strong>, and it re-emphasizes the importance thatÂ <strong>Strawberry Hands</strong>Â place on repetition â€“ it is essentially a drum loop with various metallic-sounding samples, modified guitars and what sounds like a organ jumping in occasionally â€“ but also, more importantly, on the way they manipulate their sound to create visuals through their music.Â <em>â€œJim is a painter and I think he really considers fidelity in the way he considers color or light in his paintings,â€</em>Â <strong>Brunner</strong>Â told me.Â <em>â€œThey're very closely related.â€</em>\r\n\r\nAttention to sonic texture is nothing new, of course, but usually bands find one they like and stick to it.Â <strong>Strawberry Hands,</strong>Â though, seem intent on fitting the texture to the given song, just as painters change the textures of their work. This can be disorienting â€“ so few bands take these sonic liberties â€“ but it also proves incredibly rewarding. These two songs demonstrate their ability to experiment with different qualities of sound to convey drastically contrasting moods.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ll leave with some words fromÂ <strong>JakeÂ </strong><strong>Brunner</strong>, who is far more eloquent about his music than I:\r\n\r\n<em>â€œFor me I think that there's something tragic and severe about repetition in music. It can lead to trances, to real ecstasy and a release from the bonds of material awareness, but I feel like there's also this Sisyphean quality to it, this kind of no exit, eternal recurrence vibe.â€</em>",

		"content" : "Records often become inextricably tied to the place and moment in our lives when we hear them. Music's power to latch itself on to our memories is truly remarkable: a single song can completely transport the listener back into that mood in ways that mere recollection cannot. They are an easy ticket for re-experiencing the past. But sometimes we associate them with memories that are too painful to confront, and they become unplayable. Listening to records that can arouse such intense emotional memory is a risky business, but it is perhaps that deeply affecting quality that makes music great.\r\n\r\n<strong>Boy Without God (Gabe Birnbaum)</strong>Â has made one those records, one of those (and we all have our own favorites) that somehowÂ <em>got under my skin</em>Â and stayed there. The particular moments I associate with it are dark and dramatic, but thatâ€™s not to say Boy Without God is a downer. Exuberant and full-blooded, Boy Without God creates music that is so raw that it will undoubtedly hit you hard; in what way, itâ€™s hard to say.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s in large part due to his crafting of soundscapes.Â <strong>Boy Without God</strong>Â likes his sound meaty: lo-fi need not apply here. He wraps you in a variety of unusual timbres and creates tension and release by gradually expanding that space. No place is this more in evidence that onÂ <strong>\"Holy Holy Little Fist\"</strong>, the no-holds barred opener on this digital 7-inch that showcases Boy Without GodÂ at his best: going for broke. Beginning with an arresting organ line and spare drum machine, the song is propelled by layer upon layer of vocals, percussion, a flurry of hand claps, and finally bursts of frenetic horns (all played by Boy Without GodÂ himself) that showcase his unique combination of indie rock and free-jazz. Where most rock musicians shy away from such frenetic dissonance, Boy Without GodÂ relishes in these moments while using them sparingly to heighten the effect.\r\n\r\nâ€œ<strong><em>Boy Without God</em></strong>â€ suggests some type of existential searching, and his lyrics reflect this humanistic outlook inÂ <strong>\"Holy Holy Little Fist\"</strong>.Â <em>â€œI know fate is a lead coat/weighin on our/silky ties and dead bolts/ all our exoskeletons/ I know fate is lead, molten/pouring into/forms we cannot understand/ guided by our own two hands.â€Â </em>This rejection of fate, this emphasis on the earthy (in the same song he declares,Â <em>â€œWe are fields of wise goats defecating joyfullyâ€</em>) can be disorienting for listeners used to music drenched in irony and cynicism. But the conviction with which he sings seems to say: so be it. His deep, growly baritone â€“ which he often over-dubs multiple times â€“ recalls Matt Berninger of The National, but that doesnâ€™t stop him from pushing his voice to the upper reaches of his register until heâ€™s at a full out scream. Sincerity is only revolting when it veers into melodrama, and Boy Without GodÂ is anything but that.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"If You\"</strong>Â is an intimate, hopeful ballad--the yin to the yang ofÂ <strong>\"Holy Holy Little Fist\"</strong>.Â <strong>Boy Without GodÂ </strong>adds his distinctive orchestral temperament to an otherwise sparse guitar track, adding smudges of horns and vibraphones to create a warm, welcoming palate. You get a sense of his extreme vulnerability here, but itâ€™s an endearing vulnerability, not a pitiful one. In the same way that Elliott Smith used to turn his sadness into beauty, Boy Without GodÂ has a talent for turning his loneliness into something more.\r\n\r\nThis two track single fromÂ <strong>Boy Without God</strong>Â gives a small taste of his talent; his other work hints at the epic instrumental genius of Sufjan Stevens but with none of his cringe-worthy sentimentality. With a broader musical palate to work with than most indie rockers and flair for the dramatic, Boy Without God makes music that's adventurous without being distancing; music that is, in fact, deeply arresting and personal. And memorable.",

		"content" : "<strong>Weyes Bluhd</strong>Â is good enough to inspire elaborate suicidal fantasies. That may seem like ridiculous blog hyperbole, but for a brief moment in the summer of 2006, it was truer than true. It was my first summer as a college student. I was living in a tiny but expensive walk-up in the LES, spiritually vacant and utterly depressed, making frequent trips to visit my girlfriend in Philadelphia where a small, committed group of artists were turning me on to the rich possibilities of DIY. There were a lot of great bands playing an endless variety of venues, but for my money, the cream of the crop was a young girl from Doylestown, PA (~45 minutes North of Philly) by the name ofÂ <strong>Natalie Mering</strong>.\r\n\r\nOn the Philly circuit, she was known asÂ <strong>Wiseblood</strong>. Playing intimate, mostly house-set shows with the constantly evolving crew of Dark Juices (Jim Strong of Wrinkle, Floating Market; Jordan Burgis of The Furniture, Quantum Spine Recordings; many others),Â <strong>Mering</strong>Â thoroughly stoked the Philadelphia community. At that time, her music was a slab of melancholy folk with goosebump-inducing, butter-voiced melodies adorned by the Dark Juicesâ€™ mysterious amalgam of tape-collage, sonorous metallic objects and other unusual textures. In short, it killed, and it was the most beautiful music Iâ€™d ever heard in my 19 years on Earth (stickÂ <em>that</em>Â in your hyperbole pipe). So much so, in fact, that after a performance at the now-defunct Haunted Cream Egg, I approached Mering with these words:Â <em>â€œOne day, I want you to be singing to me with a knife between your feet, cutting my throat as I die by your song.â€</em>Â Melodramatic, I know. I meant every word.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2009. A lot has happened since forÂ <strong>Mering</strong>Â since then. After a stint in Portland that included music classes at Lewis and Clark college and falling in with the excellent Americana-cum-psychedelic free-improv band Jackie O-Motherfucker (whose 2000 releaseÂ <strong>Fig. 5Â </strong>deserves a serious listen), she returned to the Philadelphia area to continue performing and recording. 2007 saw the self-release of her debut full-length, the intriguingÂ <strong>Strange Chalices of Seeing</strong>. Though the record contains Meringâ€™s trademark pipes, theyâ€™re often matched, if not obscured, by infinite layers of mystery noise. Sometimes theyâ€™re not present at all, as in the case ofÂ <strong>â€œRemote Beach at Avernus Ã  Stretched Out Staircase,â€</strong>Â which begins as a Paleolithic drum circle under Angus Maclise-like oscillation freakouts and then transitions, with the elegantly abrupt whir of a tape-splice, into unsettlingly cavernous drone territory.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s an exercise in willfully obscure textures, sound for the sake of mystery and pleasure, a scarily focused mystical text that makes you grit your teeth at the sight ofÂ <em>â€œLo-Fi.â€</em>Â Sure, this isnâ€™t high-production studio wizardry (itâ€™d be abandoning its DIY ethic if it were), but itâ€™s no cheap gimmick either. Itâ€™s fidelity being used self-consciously, not just as a means of representation (i.e. trying to maintain fidelity to the sound of the original source) but rather as a source of abstract expression (i.e. obscuring the original source in novel ways to produce new, more meaningful texturesâ€”<em>â€œa splinter in the eye is the best magnifying glassâ€</em>). Itâ€™s the moment when the painter stops using paint to represent a nude woman â€˜realisticallyâ€™ and throws paint on the canvas to express the violence subtending her appeal. This is the moment whenÂ <strong>Wiseblood</strong>Â was reincarnated asÂ <strong>Weyes Bluhd</strong>â€”when gorgeous gothic hymns were misspelled as acid-drenched landscapes with a menacing, subliminal center.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to theÂ <strong>\"Shattered Mirror\"/\"Liquor Castle\" 7-inch</strong>.Â <strong>â€œShattered Mirrorâ€</strong>Â marks an interesting development in the Weyes Bluhd catalogue. Not as pretty as some of the earliest ballads (which, as far as I know, have never been released), not as deranged as some of the material onÂ <strong>Strange Chalices of Seeing</strong>, the track is a true balancing act of influences. I hear an acknowledgment of pop classics in the drumbeat, that classic Jesus and Mary Chain-by-way-of-The Ronettes stomp. But in typicalÂ <strong>Weyes Bluhd</strong>Â fashion, the familiar element is refracted through a prism of mystery. The result is a beat without a snare, the drumâ€™s familiar pop replaced by a ringing, bell-like sonority in some parts and a blood-curdling, trebly scrape in others. Even the pretty vocal melody is made more severe by an undercurrent of surrealistic spoken-word (<em>â€œtime is like a mirror, counting the days and eyesâ€</em>). This sound certainly supports the closest thing to a musical manifesto I ever got fromÂ <strong>Mering</strong>:Â <em>â€œI want to play an ancient song, but through the sonic elements of tape collage and electronics, accidental sounds that rejuvenate the melodic archetype while also thrusting it into the future.â€</em>\r\n\r\nThe element of poetry is brought to the forefront inÂ <strong>â€œLiquor Castle,â€Â </strong>which begins with a long feedback-fu*ked moan and continues through a hailstorm of harmonics guitar (a large board zither that isolates string timbre into individual harmonics, invented by NY-godhead and guitar-orchestra pioneer Glenn Branca) and occasionally decipherable words. I canâ€™t pretend to know whatâ€™s happening in the language-scapeâ€”which is probably more than half the pointâ€”but it has its moments of weird narrative clarity (<em>â€œthey asked me why I was drinking from up there, thatâ€™s what they use to wash their floors up thereâ€</em>).Â <strong>Weyes Bluhd</strong>Â has carved out a truly unique soundworld with these tracks. The closest reference point that I can think of is UK-underground stalwarts The Shadow Ring, whose wordsmith Graham Lambkin has performed alongsideÂ <strong>Mering</strong>Â and made an obvious impression on her musical vocabulary.\r\n\r\nIf these tracks are any indication,Â <strong>Weyes Bluhdâ€™s</strong>Â forthcoming LP will be a strong marriage of her across-the-spectrum influences, from straightforward songwriting to confusing noise of otherworldy timbre. As much as the Blood inÂ <strong>Natalie Meringâ€™s</strong>Â moniker suggests love, longing and connection, it also signals violence of the psychedelic cult-horror variety. You may not want to die listening to this music, but you may not have a choice.",

		"content" : "Some would say metal is the easiest genre to parody because of its obsessive maximalism. Clearly, any metalhead worth his or her warpaint could immediately name some examples to the contrary. What about some of that minimalist black metal like Ildjarn or Striborg, recorded in one take on a Sony tape player by a rustic lunatic? Or the whole genre of grindcore, predicated on the principle of compressing what could conceivably be a six-minute song if it were performed by, say, Suffocation, into a denser-than-Iridium thirty seconds? OK, these are valid points, but not the right points. Metal over-the-topness is all about the aesthetics of production, lyrics, instrumentation, dress-sense, or, to be more specific: distortion, Satan, double-kicks and spikes. Like in the case of the statementÂ <em>\"not all smokers get cancer,\"</em>Â the exceptions to the rule do not necessarily make the rule untrue. Smoking, for all intents and purposes, will give you cancer. But metal is a different theoretical beast. Metal, despite all signs to the contrary, is not about maximalism, but, at its core, is a fundamentally minimalist art. Some artists, like Mick Barr of Orthrelm and Krallice, totally get this: shred patterns repeated to infinity, the sound file directly translatable into a binary grid of drums on the x axis and guitar on the y. Itâ€™s counterintuitive, but this mutating 2-bit virus of a style is the closest thing metal has to a soul.Â <strong>RAUL</strong>, out of New York, is another one of the rare groups to grasp this paradox. They've performed the kind of weird alchemy necessary to separate theÂ <em>ding as sich</em>Â of the genre from the frilly bullshit that so typically clings to it like maggots to a disintegrating ham.\r\n\r\nCheck the intro toÂ <strong>â€œCampaign Trail Mix.â€</strong>Â Some amp fuzz, cymbal brushes and then a plodding three-note figure, it might qualify as the reverse of bombastic. The whole thing plods like a Diplodocus through the motions of what metal intros are supposed to be in such a hyper-literal way that the passage becomes both comedic and transcendent. By stripping away the stylistic armor, putting the exposed cliche under an electron microscope and pressing the red circle,Â <strong>RAUL</strong>Â has given us videotape of the genreâ€™s underlying genotype. The effect is not unlike unbuttoning Andre the Giantâ€™s leotard only to find that his whole, testosterone-inflated body falls off with it like a fat suit, leaving behind only a 2-Dimensional sprite of its original self standing in the ring. Yup, just like that.\r\n\r\nThe band has a lot of range, too: acoustic numbers, hazy atmospherics, falsetto singing. TakeÂ <strong>â€œLatin America,â€</strong>Â a soft-ish prog jam with a gorgeous vocals and some jazz-tastic noodling. Itâ€™s as if there were actually a band called Simon and Gar-fu*k-all. These things both matter and donâ€™t matter, the former because it sounds great, and the latter becauseÂ <strong>RAULâ€™s</strong>Â whole point is that the salad dressing doesnâ€™t really alter the vegetables underneath.\r\n\r\nThe constants, on the other hand, are absolutely crucial. Take, for instance, the trebly fuzztone of the guitars, darting from song to song like the haloed tracer on a green-lit radar screen. Or the goofy song titles, something, I admit, I was a bit apprehensive about before giving them a listen. WhileÂ <strong>â€œWhale Life &gt; Human Lifeâ€</strong>Â and the aforementionedÂ <strong>â€œCampaign Trail Mixâ€</strong>Â may push your Titus Andronicus, or, God forbid, The Number Twelve Looks Like You buttons, donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s actually a genius move. While various shitty metalcore bands use arch humor to hide their total lack of insight into the music they make,Â <strong>RAULÂ </strong>is actually burrowing into the classic metal tradition of I-Am-The-Album-Cover. But while Altars of Madness is pure stunt masquerading as evil, RAUL takes the same source material and feeds it through a random word generator. The result isnâ€™t evil, really, but the psychology of evil at the level of the amigdala. Fear and humor, they know, originate in the same place.",

		"content" : "Thereâ€™s something about the guitar/drum duo that lends it instantÂ credibilityÂ in my eyes and ears. Bands like the Japandroids, PS I Love You, andÂ <strong>Amazing/Wow</strong>Â are the stuff that rock music is made of, and Iâ€™m just a sucker for bands that really let their balls hang out. If you canâ€™t say what you need to say in 3 chords and with shitty distorted singing, maybe you need to sit back and reconsider the whole rock music thing, eh? I mean, you can gussie it all up with harmony and some tricky chord substitutions, but a rose is a rose is a roseâ€“they donâ€™t really do a whole lot to change theÂ fundamentalÂ character of the music. Amazing/Wow is just two dudes, banginâ€™ it out, but they elevate the whole venture to such epic proportions that a whole army of guitarists (a â€œguitarmy,â€ if you will) couldnâ€™t show them up on stage. Fellow Ampeater writer Nick Kelly sawÂ <strong>Amazing/Wow</strong>Â a while back, and wrote,Â <em>â€œAmazing/Wow is really one of those bands that hits their stride live. You can get a sense of their raw energy from their recordings, but seeing them live is truly a physically overwhelming experience. Instead of going to another big-name show at Webster Hall and having to pinch yourself mid-way through to confirm that you are not in fact dead, go see Amazing/Wow in a loft somewhere. They singlehandedly reminded me that sometimes all you need is a bit of melody and a whole lot of adrenaline to make music worthwhile.â€</em>Â Hell yeah, thatâ€™s the spirit.<strong>Â Amazing/Wow</strong>Â isÂ <strong>Barrett Lindgren</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Adam Ferguson</strong>, and theyâ€™ve been making abrasive punk music with delicious pop hooks for only about a year now. Based out of West Philly, these guys are the real fu*king deal. Keeping the DIY tradition alive, Amazing/Wow isnâ€™t label bound, but their recordings are killer enough to keep me headbanging at my desk all day long. Moreover, withstanding one of their live shows is purportedly akin to surving a tornado. Awesome, sign me up.\r\n\r\nSo now down to the real business: weâ€™re serving up a nice new digital 7-inch fromÂ <strong>Amazing/Wow</strong>, so check it out. Side A is a punk anthem for the new millennium called<strong>Â â€œWe Donâ€™t Need Anything.â€</strong>Â Theyâ€™re right, they donâ€™t need anythingâ€“not even a bassist. Fu*k bassists. The song takes off with some hefty feedback, ushering in a vocal intro and a hovering guitar part that suddenly casts us off into the meat of the song before we really know what hit us. I donâ€™t think I had heard anything made in my lifetime that actually propelled me to punch the air during the chorus until I found this song. Amazing/Wow has a pretty basic agenda that they fulfill with style: punk songs + catchy melodies + lots of raw untamed masculine energy. Even the most apathetic of hipsters will find themselves looking like bearded bobble-head dolls when they put this one on.Â <strong>â€œWe Donâ€™t Need Anythingâ€</strong>Â is a perfect example of what makes Amazing/Wow so great. Listen to it, now. Seriously, scroll to the bottom of the post and click play. The rest of the review will still be here when you finish.\r\n\r\nThe B-Side of this disk,Â <strong>â€œCovered in Blood,â€</strong>Â shows what separatesÂ <strong>Amazing/Wow</strong>Â from your normal run-of-the-mill two person punk band (though I refuse to believe that such a thing actually exists). Amazing/Wow combines pop and punk in a way that gives credence to both genres. The song builds over a two-note riff, adding tambourine and drums until the vocals finally enter and remind us that weâ€™re listening to something very, very special. The refrain,Â <em>â€œI would like to see your face covered in blood,â€</em>Â gives way to a 3-chord straight punk riff that quickly becomes just a little embarassed by itself and drops us back into the indie-infused shell of the song. The songâ€™s a bitÂ schizophrenicÂ like that, alternating between a deep indie guitar groove and straight punk. Oddly, I miss one when Iâ€™m hearing the other, which is maybe why Iâ€™ve had this song on repeat for hours now. Itâ€™s the perfect balance between music that draws heavily on a certain genre and music thatâ€™s directly referential. This is the kind of tune that gets jammed deep inside your head and stays there, but since you canâ€™t really sing and have a shitty memory, the version thatâ€™s in your head is always slightly out of tune and just loops half a verse over and over again. Practice makes perfect?\r\n\r\nIâ€™d be remiss if I didnâ€™t admit that thereâ€™s some dissention amongst the Ampeater crew as to what songs areÂ <strong>Amazing/Wowâ€™s</strong>Â best. I won on the 7-inch and got my two favorites, but Nick would insist thatÂ <strong>â€œWhere is the Universe</strong>â€ andÂ <strong>â€œLaserfaceâ€</strong>Â better capture the bandâ€™s synthesis of pop and punk, as they actually take a second to breathe and let a couple notes ring out every once in a while. I guess thatâ€™s okay, but part of what makes Amazing/Wow so potent is pure endurance, both in terms of their own performance and what they demand from their listeners. Itâ€™s not an easy task to keep up with Amazing/Wow, but if youâ€™re up for a good time itâ€™s one hell of a ride.",

		"content" : "The first time I sawÂ <strong>Charlie Looker</strong>, I felt bad for the dude. Here he was with his bandÂ <strong>Zs</strong>, playing Philly for the first time, pouring every ounce of energy and spirit into the performance. I was a young buck, only 16, smoking cigarettes outside and waiting for headliners Les Georges Leningrad to come on when my friend sent me a stern text from the belly of the beast:Â <em>\"Dude. Come in.\"</em>Â So I curiously re-entered my favorite church basement to find six airtight musicians blasting away with horrible symmetry, squawky sax shards playing against dissonant guitar chords and wonderfully unpredictable rhythmic cells. To put it simply, Zs took me to the nether regions of musical abstraction and I never looked back. Unfortunately, the majority of the crowd was less receptive. Between songs the young band endured some pretty brutal mockery. If anything, I think that response was a good indicator of how forward-thinking, how much musicians' musicians Zs truly were. And hey, all's well that ends well: Several years and performances later, Zs had attained legendary status in the New York avant-community, playing some of the most mind-altering new music ever laid to space, with balls to boot. How many new music ensembles have you seen where the drummer breaks his bass drum playing too hard?\r\n\r\n<strong>Charlie Looker</strong>Â was a founding member of that bandÂ <em>â€œback in 2001 when I was just a tiny shoot,â€</em>Â as he put it to me. As a student at Wesleyan duringÂ <strong>Zsâ€™</strong>Â formative years he would commute down to New York for rehearsals, the rest of his band being enrolled at the Manhattan School of Music. He even traveled to the Czech Republic for a music conference with members of Zs. As Charlie once told me,Â <em>â€œwe were really up in each othersâ€™ headsâ€Â </em>(how else could one make music so f-ing tight?). Clearly, the incredible uniformity of the bandâ€™s expression was an extension of their personal connection, their countless hours spent together poring over the smallest of musical details. So you can understand my surprise when Charlie left Zs to pursue his solo material as<strong>Â Extra Life</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Extra Life</strong>Â marks a certain departure from the music ofÂ <strong>Zs</strong>. Although Charlie was responsible for one of the only (and best) Zs songs with lyrics inÂ <strong>â€œNobody Wants to be Had,â€</strong>Â very little of the Zs material displayed the wonderful melodic sensibilities that have been put to the fore in his solo material.Â <em>â€œThis was my return to singing, which had been a part of my music pre-Zs but had fallen by the wayside,â€</em>Â explains Charlie.Â <em>â€œIt was my return to my voice, but in a way it was my real beginning as a vocal stylist with my own vibe. I got so inspired by the solo songs that I decided to form a band and do tight arrangements of them. I got so into the band that I left Zs to do Extra Life full-on.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Extra Life</strong>Â still retains some of the compositional moves that madeÂ <strong>Zs</strong>Â such an intriguing force. The element of rhythmic abstraction, a topic I had the pleasure of discussing many times with Charlie, is still retained in all its glory. Check the asymmetrical sludge ofÂ <strong>A-side â€œI Donâ€™t See It That Way.â€</strong>Â Itâ€™s a true feat of the manipulation of musical time. You want to sway with its giant, lumbering riff, but the temporal irregularities make you quiver as though at the feet of a stumbling drunk monster. This is one of the best examples of a consciously non-metrical rhythmic style, where the rhythm is freed from traditional parameters and given a new range of unpredictability and expression. The song also revealsÂ <strong>Lookerâ€™s</strong>Â gift for textural contrast. The high-tone accentuated hi-hat triplet is a wonderful move that gives the melody an even more dynamic quality and makes those bass tones seem all the more fearsome. Looker traces some of these moves back to his days at Wesleyan when he was fortunate enough to study under modern musical deity Anthony Braxton:Â <em>â€œI was never a deep disciple of Braxton, but I took classes with him in college and played a little with him. He is deep. I can say that playing Braxtonâ€™s music exposed me to a certain rigorous approach to very irregular rhythms. That shows up clearly in the music I wrote for Zs and on a lot of the first Extra Life record.â€</em>Â Of course, this shouldnâ€™t be taken as an opportunity to pigeonhole looker as some kind of prog nerd. Lookerâ€™s manipulation of musical material goes far beyond the look-what-I-can-do aesthetic of many similarly technically proficient musicians. He once described his compositional process as letting the notes tell him, so to speak, the rhythmic organization, as opposed to entering the creative zone with a preconceived idea of which moves to employ. In more recent correspondence, Looker hints at a new direction:Â <em>â€œNowadays my rhythms are straightening out again (relatively speaking). So who knows where the Braxton influence has gone. That rhythmic language isnâ€™t really specifically Braxtonian anyway, itâ€™s part of modernist classical music too.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Extra Lifeâ€™s</strong>Â influences run much deeper than 20th century abstract alchemists:Â <em>â€œSome of the music that has moved me most deeply over the years has come from experimental metal, modern classical composers, Medieval and Renaissance music, free jazz, goth and new wave pop. My lyrics are always somewhat informed by what Iâ€™m reading, which over the past year has included Georges Bataille, Oscar Wilde and the Sopranos. When I write music I draw upon everything I have ever loved, but so much of that is unconscious. Itâ€™s often hard to say where certain elements or aspects come from. I donâ€™t make music as a direct reference to influences from the past, the way most current bands in indie rock do. Whatever I may be informed by, my record or book collection isnâ€™t the topic of the music.â€</em>\r\n\r\nThis is what gives the music ofÂ <strong>Extra Life</strong>Â its particular power. Rather than constructing a lineage of influences, Looker constructs a lineage of experience that is both intensely private and cosmically radiant. When he sings about the dog-eat-dog mentality of modern life onÂ <strong>â€œI Donâ€™t See It That Way,â€Â </strong>heâ€™s not just painting a confession of personal experience, heâ€™s letting us in on the discussion as if to say,Â <em>â€œyouâ€™re a part of my world, youâ€™re implicated in this giant social web, where do you stand?â€</em>Â As Looker explains, this is by no means accidental:Â <em>â€œWhat inspires Extra Life on a more general level are my personal experiences and feelings, conscious reflection, pure willpower and most importantly communion with the most unconscious levels of intuition. The unconscious processes are whatâ€™s most important because thatâ€™s what imagination really is. Any sensitive person can have intense emotions, any intelligent person can reflect on them, and willpower can always be summoned; but when these things resonate with the Unconscious, both personal and collective, thatâ€™s when the music takes on the mystic power I aim for. Thatâ€™s why very different people can relate to Extra Life, people with different experiences, tastes, backgrounds. No matter how personal or esoteric the source is, Extra Life aspires to the universal.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œIâ€™ll Burn,â€</strong>Â an acoustic version from a split 10â€ with the Dirty Projectorsâ€™s Nat Baldwin (Shatter Your Leaves, 2009), originally on the debut LPÂ <strong>Secular Works</strong>Â (I and Ear, 2007), foregrounds one of the most present forces inÂ <strong>Extra Life</strong>: Medieval music. Listen to howÂ <strong>Looker</strong>Â flexes his melismatic muscles like a modern-day Machaut, a fittingly gorgeous vehicle for sad, humble lyrics.Â <em>â€œMedieval music is beautiful and cold,â€</em>Â he told me,Â <em>â€Itâ€™s some of the most gorgeous, serene, entrancing, transcendent music ever. Even though itâ€™s thoroughly pleasing to the ears, and hardly ever dissonant, itâ€™s still so alien in many ways. The medieval sense of melodic unfolding is so exotic and subtly nuanced, I canâ€™t even claim to have a full grip on it. There are a million nerdy musical details which I love about Medieval music. But I think for me itâ€™s really about the spirit of it. This was a time when not only did everyone believe in God and lived every minute quaking in fear and love of him, but they had a correspondingly devout belief in the power of music to change consciousness. All medieval music is just radiant with the deep belief that music is a movement of the soul. You can feel that conviction emanating from it. They believed that tuning systems and musical intervals corresponded to relationships of the planets and stars. Cosmic harmony, music of the spheres. To them, how two notes were combined wasnâ€™t just an issue of aesthetics but one of the highest cosmic, moral and spiritual order. Half the bands in Brooklyn right now canâ€™t even work their guitar pedals. You see what Iâ€™m getting at here? I also love Medieval music because I feel it has this real sense of humility, in a way which I could see as both dark and enlightened. It doesnâ€™t sound proud or self-congratulatory like classical music or later European music. Thereâ€™s this sense of Man as a tiny insect crawling the earth, totally humble in the face of invisible forces which could either uplift or crush him. Itâ€™s shrouded in darkness and abasement but it aspires upward toward the divine. Itâ€™s the sound of a culture starting over from nothing after Rome burned. The start of the Age of Pisces, Christâ€™s age. I think you can feel this in the music. In a way I guess itâ€™s a far cry from our current cultural spirit, but if our civilization destroys itself weâ€™ll find ourselves again in something like this Medieval state: hanging our heads before God, picking through ruins and using our imagination to interpret omens while we pick through burnt books, shards of bones and cell phones.â€</em>",

		"content" : "<strong>Pet Ghost ProjectÂ </strong>started off as a one man band, the moniker of Seattle based singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalistÂ <strong>Justin Stivers</strong>. A few years ago, Stivers moved to the Big Apple where he has immersed himself in Brooklynâ€™s bustling indie scene. In the studio, Stivers is a \"one man wrecking crew\" who stacks layers upon layer of himself to build a huge sound. On stage and increasingly in the studio,Â <strong>Justin GonzalezÂ </strong>andÂ <strong>Jake More</strong>Â lend their skills to the mix. All multi-instrumentalists, the three members of Pet Ghost Project switch off on guitar, percussion, bass, and keyboards. The result is a fun and slightly chaotic live show, which is definitely worth checking out if you have the chance.\r\n\r\nBut enough biographical informationâ€”have those MP3s finishedz downloading yet? If you have a slow connection it may take a few minutes. And Iâ€™ll give you another minute to drag them onto your 160 GB iPod Touch and wait it to synch. When youâ€™re plugged in and ready to go, read on.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Joni Mitchell,Â <em>â€œthey paved paradise and put up a parking lot.â€</em>Â Ever since the dawn of civilization there have been those whoâ€™ve longed for a simple time. Mitchell felt this urge, so did Thoreau, Rousseau, Proust, Orwell... When bluegrass musicians in Appalachia first saw tape recorders they called them song-suckers and the popularity of films such as The Terminator and The Matrix demonstrate that our fear of technology has not disappeared in recent years. So yes, the clash between technology and nature isnâ€™t exactly a new theme, butÂ <strong>Pet Ghost Project</strong>Â addresses it in a nuanced and refreshingly entertaining way. Which brings us to theÂ <strong>A-side â€œAge of Automatics,â€</strong>Â so plug in those Bose noise-canceling headphones and press play.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s begin by stating the obvious; the song is catchy as hell. A few listens and the melodic hook will be permanently lodged in the darkest reaches of your mind. And the persistent bell in the background, counterpoint to a softly clanking guitar, twinkles playfully like Christmas in July.Â <strong>Stivers</strong>Â originally envisioned the song as a simple acoustic ditty, but it took on a new life in production. The final mix is orchestrated in a way that brings to mind Andrew Bird. Bursts of emotional rawness shine through a rich and glossy indie aesthetic. Perhaps such departure from its simple roots was the only logical progression for a song addressing the gray area between nature and technology. The music is a battleground on which this conflict is resolvedâ€¦ or not resolved despite mutual destruction?\r\n\r\nOne momentÂ <strong>Stivers</strong>Â is singing in a breathy telephone-box voice and the next moment heâ€™s shouting spastically through a tank of reverb. Or rather, through a large and reverberant bathroomâ€”no synthetics involved, the only ingredients passion and perhaps a little alcohol.\r\n\r\n<em>Sung: Weâ€™re not afraid, we're not afraid of danger. We keep it close, we welcome in a stranger.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Shouted: I couldnâ€™t laugh, I couldnâ€™t force myself to think about it. I wouldnâ€™t try, I wouldnâ€™t try my luck to state the truth yeah.</em>\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy bridge the main theme returns but absent are the raw reverb drenched shouts. Only one breathy voice remains, the city has devoured the countryâ€¦\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to theÂ <strong>B-side â€œThey Built a City in my Country Mind.â€</strong><strong>Â Stivers</strong><strong>Â </strong>calls it a vocal feature but the human voice is used primarily for its tone and timbre, as another instrument. He recorded the song solo, stacking one layer at a time, and the process isnâ€™t obscured by the final result. The recording begins with a descending falsetto pattern. As this pattern continues, instruments and sound effects (amongst which chirping birds stand out particularly) enter gradually, building around it. And about 1:30 into the song the build finally breaks, unleashing a blast of chaos. Enter distorted electric guitars. Enter heavy drum beat. Exit (or simply drowned out?) acoustic strumming, birds singing. The city has arrived. Continue the soft falsettos, but re-contextualized, against the backdrop of rock. Suddenly in a brief calm, the soft harmonics of guitar and the sound of pick against string ring out. Calm again, but the build continuesâ€¦ Itâ€™s over 3 minutes before lyrics come in,Â <em>â€œthey built a city in my country mind.â€</em>Â The vocal melody is mirrored on distorted guitar, and the two melt together to create one unique voice, neither guitar nor human. And maybe thatâ€™s the perfect compromise. In other words, you donâ€™t have to take off those headphones, but maybe next time youâ€™ll take your iPod Touch on a walk down some peaceful country road.",

		"content" : "As a musician and music lover, I'm always on the lookout for new bands. Over the years I've found music in a lot of interesting places, but I'll always remember the way I discoveredÂ <strong>Color of Clouds</strong>. We'd all like to be famous. A few months ago, I plugged my name, Nate Greenberg, into Google to see how many hits popped up. Sadly, I did not top the list, nor was I even the most famous Nathan Greenberg in the music world. Instead I stumbled across a music producer namedÂ <strong>Nathan Greenberg</strong>Â from Brooklyn and his band, Color of Clouds. And they were good. Flash forward to October-<a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/tag/ben-heller\">Ben Heller</a>, a friend and Ampeater Review co-conspirator, tells me that he met Color of Clouds during a recording session at Serious Business Records and that they were interested in an Ampeater write up. It seemed so serendipitous that I jumped at the chance to write the review.\r\n\r\n<strong>Color of Clouds</strong>Â is an electro-acoustic trio featuring members from the electronic rock outfitÂ <strong>Moonraker</strong>. SingerÂ <strong>Kelli Scarr</strong>, who appears on several tracks of Moby's latest albumÂ <strong>Wait for Me</strong>, resumed collaborating with songwriter/producerÂ <strong>Dan Chen</strong>Â in late 2008. Soon their collaborations became the impetus for a new band and they recruited production master Greenberg to fill out the lineup. The resulting sound is a mixture of indie-folk/pop, tinged with electronics, which has been described asÂ <em>\"what it would sound like if Feist were to sing with the Flaming Lips\"</em>. Simple electronics accent the flowing, yet restrained instrumental parts, providing the perfect background to Scarr's sultry vocals. Chen also sings on several songs, and the subtle blend of their two voices sometimes sounds as if only one vocalist were in the room.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side \"Brother\"</strong>Â is a smooth and poignant jam. When I listen to it I feel like Iâ€™m gazing out at the world through a raindrop glazed window. Everything is soft and a little blurry. A meandering cello, wavering guitar, subdued piano, and gently brushed drums melt into a lush background.Â <strong>Scarrâ€™s</strong>Â voice takes the spotlight and her lyrics shine over the mix.Â <strong>Chen</strong>Â notes,<em>Â â€œKelli brought it in as a pretty complete sketch on her acoustic, and it didn't take much for us to come up with the extra sections needed to finish it. I love this track because production-wise we left a great deal of it untouched; we got great performances from Yair Evnine on guitar, and Dan Mintzer on drums, and of course, an amazing vocal right off the bat from Kelli. The song stands on its own so well that we really didn't feel the need to add any bells &amp; whistles, just a touch of delay and such here and thereâ€¦ it offers a glimpse into where most of our songs come from â€“ heartfelt lyrics and a bunch of musicians quietly playing along.â€</em>Â I think thatâ€™s a fairly accurate description. Scarrâ€™s lyrics are stunningly simple, but dead on.\r\n\r\n<em>All I wanna do is tell you one more time\r\nBrother, brother\r\nBut thereâ€™s nothing I can do when the feeling isnâ€™t right\r\nMove on brother, move on brother</em>\r\n\r\nBut four bittersweet chords continue throughout most of the recording, creating a sense of cyclical momentum which complicatesÂ <strong>Scarrâ€™s</strong>Â pleas to move on. The song builds slightly but never really goes anywhere. And yet it seems strangely complete. The ending dissolves without ever really resolving, like that last raindrop trickling down the window.\r\n\r\nThe B-side is a cover of Lou Reedâ€™s 1972 hitÂ <strong>\"Satellite of Love\"</strong>. Iâ€™m usually skeptical of covers, but every now and then I find a cover that eclipses the original. This is one of those covers, and thatâ€™s quite a claim, since I love Reedâ€™s version. ButÂ <strong>Color of Clouds</strong>Â strips the song down to its bare bones, leaving a sense of intimacy not present in the original.Â <strong>Chen</strong>Â recalls,Â <em>â€œ[the song] has been a favorite of mine since high school, and during a week of recording sessions with Color of Clouds, it popped up randomly on my iPod, and I immediately knew that we had to cover it.â€</em>Â Itâ€™s a natural enough choice; the song is a perfect fit forÂ <strong>Scarr</strong>â€™s voice. But with her singing, the song takes on a new life, approaching something that Mr. Reedâ€™s voice never could: cute. While the lyrics tell a story of a jealous love, the music is full of hope. The outro boasts one of the most uplifting chord progressions in any song out there, and Color of Clouds rolls with it. The intimate acoustic sing-along, clap-your-hands vibe accentuates the joy embodied in those three chords. On that note, their decision to cut the bridge, which returns to jealousy and tinges the original outro with a sense of bitterness, seems wholly appropriate.\r\n\r\n<strong>Color of Clouds's</strong>Â debut,Â <strong>The Look EP</strong>, was released in May 2009, and they plan to follow up with a full-length album in early 2010. Stay tuned. I expect it won't be long before my poor name is brutally overshadowed.",

		"content" : "<strong>Ashraya Gupta</strong>Â is a voice out of another era - though exactly what era is up for debate. She most immediately recalls the sweet, delicate voices of 60s and 70s folk singers like Vashti Bunyan, but she sings with the wispiness and tight vibrato of Billie Holiday. At certain points she even sounds even older â€“ in her precise intonation, she sounds something like an imagined popular singer from the 19<sup>th</sup>Â century. Â All of which is to say that Gutpa has an incredible voice that is immediately loved by most everyone who hears it; describing it isÂ <em>almost</em>Â a waste of time. But, since one paragraph doesn't really do her justice, let's indulge a bit.\r\n\r\n<strong>Gupta</strong>Â was born in India, raised in England and Cincinnati, and at last settled down in the most un-cosmopolitan of places (Long Island). She's been playing for years in another band--theÂ <strong>Kitchen Cabinet.Â </strong>That band, upbeat and carefree almost to a fault, provided a nice breezy compliment to Guptaâ€™s light alto. But here we get a real treat: Gupta on her own, exploring original ideas with just a keyboard to boot. Though this barebones set-up could prove monotonous or boring in anotherâ€™s hands, Gupta carries these two songs with her voice alone.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-Side</strong>Â <strong>â€œDogwoodâ€</strong>, built around a simple and haunting melody, findsÂ <strong>GuptaÂ </strong>in a near-whisper at points. The deep calm that she conveys here perfectly evokes a mood that is at once lonely and hopeful:Â <em>â€œDamp and dim on an empty street/morning light never looked so bleakâ€¦but on a clear day from my window/I see the palisades so green like the summer/ on a clear day from my window/I see the days when first you looked at me.â€</em>Â Itâ€™s not hard to imagine her writing this song at her window as a kind of self-medication for those lonely cold seasons, and with her warm tone and ethereal arrangements, she welcomes you in. Youâ€™re almost right there with her, looking out. I first heard these songs while walking one weekend in the dim, airless hallways of a local housing project. Guptaâ€™s quiet but powerful music was the perfect anecdote to that downtrodden environment.<strong></strong><strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œGreat Expectationsâ€</strong>Â expandsÂ <strong>Guptaâ€™s</strong>Â soundscape with a minimal drum track. She sounds a bit wounded here, drowned out by the keyboards and percussion around her (if I do have one complaint, itâ€™s that I want to hear vocals, though I suspect this is more an issue of levels than arrangement). When her singing at last rises above the accompaniment at songâ€™s end, itâ€™s to deliver a real kicker:Â <em>â€œThe echo chambers of this heart/ four empty rooms to tear apart.â€</em>\r\n\r\nBoth songs on this 7-inch are modest efforts that hint at something even greater forÂ <strong>Gupta</strong>. They're little songs that pack a tight, quiet punch. Gupta's modesty â€“ in setup, in delivery, in scope â€“ suits her minimalist aesthetic, and puts the focus of her music where it belongs: on her voice. Where many solo records disappoint, becoming mere shadows of the bands that the artist usually inhabits, these two songs are gems in their own right.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

		"content" : "If Gang of Four had met and reproduced with My Bloody Valentine, and if their super fucked-up kids had been raised on The Beatles and Guided By VoicesÂ <em>and</em>Â had managed to live long enough without killing themselves to make a record, the result might sound a lot likeÂ <strong>Hotel St. George</strong>. Their music is heavily guitar-based with nouveau punk vocals, slick instrumental production that pays homage to the 70s DIY sound without quite emulating it, and enough harmonic complexity to set up and execute some brilliant hooks. Thereâ€™s really nothing to dislike here, and thereâ€™s a whole lot to merit repeat listens. But on first contact, Hotel St. George does little to grab and secure its listenership. I put it on, thought,Â <em>\"this is pretty good,\"</em>Â and went back to listening to Queensryche.Â <strong>City Boy Lemon</strong>, their latest LP release, is a grower not a show-er, and I've come back to it again and again over the past couple weeks with an eager ear to the melodic contour of their songs and the pure joy of dancing around in my underwear whileÂ <strong>Matt Binder</strong>Â singsÂ <em>\"I always dream of sex, I always dream of death, it's always on my mind, it's always on my mind.\"</em>Â Cute stuff. In sum, I've decided that I really like this band, and I'd like to share them with you guys.\r\n\r\nThey came to be over Thanksgiving 2008, when bassist/guitaristÂ <strong>Erik Visnyak</strong>Â sat down at singer/guitaristÂ <strong>Matt Binder's</strong>Â borrowed Wurlitzer piano and immediately proceeded to spill a glass of red wine on the poor creature. At this point, there were really only two things they could have done: fight to the death, or form a band. They chose the latter, bringingÂ <strong>Brian Leader</strong>Â in on drums andÂ <strong>Brian Reilly</strong>Â on guitar. In a mere two months their first EPÂ <strong>Yippee!!!</strong>Â came to be, and its modestly penned punk ditties earned the band two nominations at the San Diego Music Awards.Â <strong>Hotel St. George's</strong>Â second release,Â <strong>Hundreds &amp; Thousands</strong>, primarily featured Binder's more subtle and complex songwriting, which subsequently isolated their original fanbase of punk fans while garnering a new listenership amongst the indie crowd. Their next record,Â <strong>City Boy Lemon</strong>, split the difference between the two previous albums and offers sophistication without sacrificing an overarching punk aesthetic. Their next album promises to be a keyboard-based endeavor, which is no doubt an attempt to resolve some deep and pervasive tension regarding the Wurlitzer incident. I suppose making an album is, in fact, marginally cheaper than extended group therapy.\r\n\r\nThe two songs offered up on the 7-inch turntable today areÂ <strong>\"Apples &amp; Pears\"</strong>Â andÂ <strong>\"Island Man,\"</strong>Â the first track hearkening back to the band's roots in 70s punk and the second hinting at 2010's pop keyboard epicÂ <strong>Fun Shine Line</strong>. I love all my children equally, but if someone put a gun to my head and asked me to pick one song to use as the A-side on some imaginary \"Best of Ampeater\" 7-inch, \"Apples &amp; Pears\" would immediately come to mind. It mellows out after the first 14 seconds or so, but those first 14 seconds, man, pure gold. Never underestimate the power of a repeated ascending guitar lick--this song doesn't so much start as it does launch. Actually, that's a great analogy for what the song actually does. Once the intro riff rockets cut out, the song settles in comfortable orbit aroundÂ <strong>Matt Binder's</strong>Â delicious (though at times borderline crooning) punk vocals. Every time I wonder whether the tune's leveled out for good, that guitar riff comes back in and propels it to greater heights.Â <strong>Hotel St. George</strong>Â has mastered the manipulation of tension and delayed gratification that makes for a truly compelling song, and \"Apples &amp; Pears\" is a perfect example.\r\n\r\nIfÂ <strong>A-side \"Apples &amp; Pears\"</strong>Â is a look back at the classic punk aesthetic that formed the basis ofÂ <strong>Hotel St. George's</strong>Â music up untilÂ <strong>City Boy Lemon</strong>,Â <strong>B-side \"Island Man\"</strong>Â has a forward-looking indie vibe that hints at even greater things to come. That said, while their punk stylings are rock solid and ingeniously crafted, their indie chops are less perfectly developed. After a short vocal intro, the song lopes along for a couple seconds until it slams us with a pop chorus ofÂ <em>\"bop bop ba da, ba ba bada da\"</em>. This is a great maneuver, but the killer thing about \"Island Man\" is that it's preciously short, clocking in at 2:30, and theÂ <em>\"bops\"</em>Â only show up twice in the whole song. The solution? Loop that shit. You know that little repeat(1) button on your iPod? I use that a lot with this guy--usually 3 or 4 times does me good. \"Island Man\" gives us a peculiar marriage in a punk-length tune with pop features, and I feel like some of the melodic ideas could use a little bit more room to breathe and expand, or hell, just repeat a couple times. That's not to say that the pop features are themselves lacking in some way (in fact that's not at all the case, they're brilliant), but I nevertheless can't wait to hear how this sound evolves and matures onÂ <strong>Fun Shine Line</strong>.Â <strong>Matt Binder's</strong>Â voice does something unique on these tunes--while his punk-oriented vocals are a nod to his predecessors, he shows some individual character in the pop tunes that's apart from any immediate influence. This is where Binder as Binder shines through, and it's a good indication of Hotel St. George's potential for growth as we race towards 2010 and theÂ <em>\"new\"</em>Â Hotel St. George. Godspeed boys.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

		"content" : "I might as well get it out of the way at the beginning:Â <strong>Debo Band</strong>Â is not world music. Debo Band is something far more interesting and complex than the safe, de-contextualized commodification of music from the perceived golden age of another country sold in coffeeshop chains to cool dads wearing Keds and visors. Debo Band, organized by saxophonist and leaderÂ <strong>Danny Mekonnen</strong>Â back in 2006, is a band whose music, though it may initially sound foreign to ears weaned on indie rock, can trace its roots through almost every arena of American music. Since its inception, the band has been deeply involved in the DIY scene in Boston, playing loft parties and rock venues for the young and artistically inclined, while at the same time securing touring grants from respectable institutes like the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation. They have performed with and befriended brilliant Dutch anarcho-punx The Ex, who themselves have developed quite an interest in Ethiopian music, collaborating with legendary woolly-toned saxophonist Getatchew Mekurya on their last album.\r\n\r\nWhat is remarkable and just plain sweet aboutÂ <strong>Debo Band</strong>Â is that they manage to straddle a lot of seemingly contradictory positions. On the one hand, their music is deeply traditional, including a lot of covers of Ethiopian folk and pop songs from decades ago, yet on the other it is staunchly contemporary, incorporating original compositions and traces of the individual members other projects, which range from the dramatic post-rock silent-film soundtracks of the Devil Music Ensemble to the dancehall derived experimental electronica of sometime percussionistÂ <strong>Daniel D'Errico's</strong>Â <strong>Kiddid</strong>Â project. Even at it's very inception Debo Band was both a tribute to the Swinging Addis era of Ethiopian music and an outlet forÂ <strong>Mekonnen</strong>Â (who is also on his way to an ethnomusicology PhD at Harvard) to experiment with new forms and methods in composition. They play party music and art music at the same time, something uncommon and wonderful that they share with some of the best musicians in pop history as well as a lot of electronic contemporaries. This convergence of art and party is something exemplified by artists like Dan Deacon with his composition-induced dance frenzies as well as the whole booming dubstep scene, and as such it makes perfect sense that Debo Band should collaborate with Kiddid on this digital single. They both know how to make you get up and move.\r\n\r\nOrganizationally,Â <strong>Debo Band</strong>Â actually bears a resemblance to one of those enormous pop music collectives people always refer to asÂ <em>â€œramshackle,â€Â </em>the word ramshackle basically being code for the fact that the band drops and adds members so fast no one can actually keep track of who is in the fold at any given moment. Debo Band live usually consists of between nine and twelve members, playing the sort of Ethio-soul that American audiences, myself included, have recently been hipped to by the fantastic Ethiopiques series (or the soundtrack to Jim Jarmusch's \"Broken Flowers\" [it's okay, you can admit it]). The largely acoustic instrumentation (drums, tuba, accordion, horns, strings and vocals) is a nod that goes a touch further back than the early 70s sound of Mulatu Astatke's electric Ethio-jazz , all the way to the brass band style that captivated the country back in the first half of the 20th century, during the reign of Haile Selassie.\r\n\r\nThe A-side here is a stirring live performance ofÂ <strong>\"Aderech Arada\"</strong>, an Ethiopian song about a woman breaking out of her lawful marriage, traveling to Arada (a central area of Addis Ababa that also happens to be a red-light district) and falling into sin. You know, the usual. The time feel is a kind of loping 12/8 (actually 15/8 for much of this particular tune, if you want to get technical) that is very common inÂ <strong>Debo Band's</strong>Â music, as well as in most Ethiopian pop and traditional music. It pulls back hard whilst keeping the bass drum and hi-hat clicking on the downbeats. The result is a kind of tautly stretched and rolling time feel that locks in perfectly with the wonderfully twitchy and propulsive Ethiopian eskista shoulder dance commonly performed alongside the music.\r\n\r\nThe track is smartly arranged byÂ <strong>Mekonnen</strong>, who keeps each element from intruding on the others, yet mingles them into a satisfying whole. The accordion, the only chordal instrument here, takes on more of a melodic role, leaving a lot of open space for the drums and lilting tuba (that phrase sounds ridiculous but listen to the track and tell me that is not lilting) to carry the tense, bouncing rhythm while the horns blare out the melodies in quick, bold strokes. The call and response that happens between horns and vocals in the verses during the second half of the song is a perfect arranging touch, both propulsive and unobtrusive. The vocals themselves (headed by lead singerÂ <strong>Bruck Tesfaye</strong>, whose verse statements are answered by a chorus of keening female voices) are loaded with ornaments and a rapid vibrato which, alongside the complexity of the alternating glottal and geminated consonants, has the effect of making me sound kind of dumb when I sing along. The track is pulled from an upcoming compilation entitled 8th Ethiopian Music(s) Festival 2009, featuring as artistic director the prestigious overseer of the Ethiopiques series, Francis Falceto. The recording, done by Jeroen Visser of the Swiss F.ishing B.akery L.abs, is amazingly clean and clear for a live performance.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4043 aligncenter\" alt=\"Kiddid\" src=\"http://www.ampeatermusic.com/media/aem016/kiddid.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"666\" /></p>\r\nThe B-side isÂ <strong>Kiddid's</strong>Â remix of the very same track, a perfect illustration of the past/future, roots/wings kind of confluence<strong>Â Debo Band</strong>Â epitomizes. The opening horn salvo is left intact, leading not into the rolling, organic feel of the live version but rather into a four four backbeat with a fuzzy, unchanging bass pulse that sits perfectly between a shuffle and straight time. Part of me is convinced that the key to good dance music is that it hovers in this middle ground between time feels, much in the way that early rock and roll (Chuck Berry, for example) combined straight eighth guitar solos with swung drums. After a sparse vocal breakdown that turns the chorus of the song into something almost sinister and creepy, setting it over only metronomic ticks, the beat kicks back in, mirroring the Debo Band version by backing the horns with only the drums and aforementioned bass pulse. In this way, Kiddid shares the sparseness that is central to Debo Band's entire sound, though here it is transformed into something you'd expect to hear at a hip dance night with a one-word name. Throughout almost the entire track there is also a barely perceptible, scratchy, old-vinyl sound, perhaps a jokey reference to the impossible-to-determine age of the original recording.\r\n\r\nWhat with the fracturing of culture brought on by the endless choices of the internet, music is becoming increasingly segregated and niche-oriented, but the real gold is the stuff that opens its arms to all influences and all audiences.Â <strong>Debo Band</strong>, in their work withÂ <strong>Kiddid</strong>Â and in their collaborations with traditional Ethiopian musicians, in their performances at Ethiopian festivals and Boston loft parties, perfectly synthesizes their influences into something with the kind of musicianship that will please the traditionalists and the kind of forward-looking openness that will satisfy the young bucks. Go see them live and practice your eskista.",

		"content" : "Back in the rough and tumble days before we had music blogs and Mediafire.com and digital distros (basically before we were walking talking media receptacles), people used to get their music the only way they could: by making it. On Sundays, small town America would gather in churches and living rooms and sing all day, in huge choirs of people, most of whom were trained in music only in that they did this every damned week. Different singers conducted each song, so that there was no one leader, and everyone lifted their voices as much as they possibly could, whether those voices were rhapsodic and pure, or pop-eyed and scraggly. You may note that I am throwing some seriously drippy nostalgia at you, butÂ <em>Sacred Harp music</em>, named after a term for the human voice which doubles as the title of a major songbook from the 1840s, is hard to resist as a metaphor for the good old American spirit, with it's fierce democratic methods and community base. It also happens to be incredibly powerful and lovely, though it was never intended for a non-participating audience. There's nothing quite like hearing all those unabashed voices in unison. It takes a strange sort of idealism to think of taking this method and applying it to contemporary indie rock, and that should tell you something aboutÂ <strong>Dan Wholey</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe now-defunctÂ <strong>Earth People Orchestra</strong>Â was the project in question, and the band was fairly beloved around Boston during its brief life. Initially conceived of as a kind of open-source band in which members could freely come and go and anyone could participate, EPO drew its strength fromÂ <strong>Wholey's</strong>Â distinctive, cutting voice and smart songwriting, as well as the Sacred Harp style vocal harmonies. Dreamy, shuffling beats underscored the chorus of voices singing gently optimistic lyrics likeÂ <em>â€œI hear if you believe it you can drive out ocean tides,â€</em>Â padded underneath with harmonium and organ drones and garnished with tinkling glockenspiels. Â The effect was lovely, but this being the 2000s and not the 1840s, Wholey's idealism dissolved under the weight of conflicting egos and practicalitiesÂ (anyone who's ever been in a band knows how hard it is to get three people to play a song in time, let alone fifteen). Says Wholey of his Earth People period,Â <em>â€œthis is sort of a cool idea on paper but once you do it for a while you realize that some people should not try to break the barrier between audience and performer even though it might be a cool thing to talk about after you smoke a bunch of weed. I did learn that you should only have two drummers if your band is being followed by tens of thousands of people tripping balls.â€</em>\r\n\r\nThe man is no stranger to dissolving bands, though: his three pre-<strong>EPO</strong>Â efforts, includingÂ <strong>Jackson Plastic</strong>, a power trio with future Saddle Creek signing Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson, all self-destructed with varying degrees of violence and hurt feelings, including one punch in the face (not thrown or received byÂ <strong>Wholey</strong>, for the record) that fed the Boston indie rock gossip scene for weeks. So, he soldiered on, recording the music for various short films, includingÂ <em>I Think We're Alone Now</em>, a documentary about horrifically obsessive fans of 1980s teen pop starlet Tiffany, and then producing six solo songs in only a few days, from the latter of which this digital single is culled. The style of the solo tracks varies widely, from long, crackling drones to piano ballads to lilting banjo tunes with electronic drums, and the only thread that weaves them all together is his voice, an unwavering tenor with a nasal edge that, along with lyrics about stained mountaintops, will surely bring the name Jeff Mangum to the tips of many journalistic fingers. Beyond that touchstone, though, Wholey's voice is arguably better, slightly lower and filled out with a greater coarseness and depth. The best voices are not often the most purely beautiful, and Wholey, especially heard live, is a perfect example of how an imperfect sound can captivate completely.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side \"Draindancer\"</strong>Â bears some resemblance toÂ <strong>Wholey's</strong>Â Earth People style, with its slow shuddering beat and stringed drone, made by what sounds like a downtuned acoustic guitar being attacked with a cello bow, or maybe just a pick. The melody slowly winds its way down through the verses as if it's too heavy to be carried, landing thickly on a few unexpected notes on the way, while the lyrics lean in a more nihilistic direction than previous material, with every image resolving in a negative direction (<em>falcons fly away, juice drips down and flows away, nothing remains,Â </em>etc.), perhaps reflecting a tempered idealism after the collapse of theÂ <strong>EPO</strong>. The little melismatic flourish at the end of the word doubt is another little reminder of the power of the man's voice, something that we can hope might come even more to the fore in future recordings.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Tiny Coals\"</strong>Â hearkens back to the power trio days ofÂ <strong>Jackson Plastic</strong>, stringing fuzzy guitar chords (again, hard not to think of Avery Island era Neutral Milk Hotel hearing the wayÂ <strong>Wholey's</strong>Â voice rises over said guitars and rants about amniotic sacs, though there are certainly scads of other possible references) over some heavy, cantankerous drums, and keeping to the relatively slow tempos he favors. Again the lyrics are stark and persecuted and lonely, withÂ <em>â€œI lit a fire and fell asleep and it killed everyone I know,â€</em>Â being the main motif, and elsewhere squirrels devouring the narrator's food and models of the Titanic being sunk. Still, in the end, he is the one who lit the fire, which suggests that bleak though his position is, it's entirely his fault. The fraying of his voice during the last heldÂ <em>â€œknowâ€</em>Â is a moment of near ugliness, of a man trying desperately to figure out what to do next.\r\n\r\nFittingly,Â <strong>Wholey's</strong>Â musical future is uncertain at the moment. A pared down version ofÂ <strong>EPO</strong>Â is in the works, minus the ideology and half the band members, as well as a new power trio, and perhaps even some solo electronics. It's not clear at all where he'll wind up or what direction he'll be heading in. The one thing you can count on though, is the presence of that voice, roaring out the melodies with a bluntness that might call to mind the days when singing belonged to everyone.",

		"content" : "<strong>Jesse Rifkin</strong>Â has spiritual concerns. As if you couldn't tell from the name (<strong>The Wailing Wall</strong>, also known as the Western Wall, is the holy remnant of an ancient temple in Israel, long a place of pilgrimage and prayer for Jews and, according to some, the site of the gates of heaven), the music of The Wailing Wall trades in love and death, faith and its absence, transcendence and exile. Rifkin takes a position in a long line of smart, thoughtful troubadors with acoustic guitars and a penchant for sonic exploration and biblical references (Leonard Cohen, Bill Callahan, Jeff Mangum). Like those songwriters he manages to turn pop songcraft into something with gravity and holiness, low art into high.\r\n\r\nThere is something ancient aboutÂ <strong>Rifkin's</strong>Â music that belies his young age (23, if you're counting). Even if I'd never met him I could have instantly told you upon hearing his music that he's the kind of person my mother refers to as an old soul. Listening to<strong>Â Hospital Blossoms</strong>Â (his first full length, absolutely tingly and beautiful and available for free [what a deal!] atÂ <a href=\"http://www.jdubrecords.org/wailingwall\" target=\"_blank\">jdubrecords.org/wailingwall</a>) one hears the eternity in his songs, which are not sad but sorrowful, not happy but joyful. They are like prayers, instantly memorable and built on melodies that sound as if they were not written but summoned whole from some other world, the way they did it back in the age of the muses, when the artist was merely a vessel for divine truth. This feeling of age grounds the music so much that the melodies can be stretched and dragged, just like old folk songs, without ever losing their strength. Often you'll hear male and female voices snaking around the same melody, never quite singing it outright, never quite in rhythmic unison. It is powerful because true beauty lives in the fleeting and half-hidden, in the peripheral glimpse, something so few young musicians understand.\r\n\r\nAnd the lyrics! Oh, the lyrics. Full of resonant images like the â€œeager, eager earthâ€ awaiting bodies to fill it,<strong>Â Hospital Blossoms</strong>Â is an album of loss and struggle and drama. It seems to revolve around the illness and death of the narrator's mother, but it tends to swirl mothers, sisters and lovers together in a Mangum-esque way, resulting in one surreal, perfect, mythic feminine form, who is also of course hopelessly lost, though there are hints of possible redemption throughout. OnÂ <strong>\"Floral Park\"</strong>,Â <strong>Rifkin</strong>Â singsÂ <em>â€œwhen I see my darling cry I ask the good lord why she has to suffer,â€</em>Â which makes for a cruel juxtaposition with the recurring lyric, addressed to the sick lover,<em>Â â€œdon't you know that God above looks out for you?â€</em>Â Because of the way we listen to lyrics, catching a bit at a time over the course of many listens, the latter sounds at first listen like a declaration of faith in a troubled time, yet on repeated listens you begin to catch the whole shape of the song, and there is a moment at which the line transforms in your mind from calm serenity to bitter irony, that moment being just devastating.\r\n\r\nBeyond all the quantifiably lovely things aboutÂ <strong>Hospital Blossoms</strong>Â though, there is something else. It's in the moment in Dear Mother whenÂ <strong>Rifkin's</strong>Â vocals step forward into clarity after the scratchy, hiss-ridden quality of the first verse. It's all overÂ <strong>\"Hospital Blossom\"</strong>Â the song, especially in the move from the propulsive clicking 3/4 of the verses into the swaying 6/8 of the choruses, with their honey sweet harmonies and deeply sorrowful lyrics about longing for death in order to reunite with a lost love in heaven. It is almost by definition impossible to put into words but it's important, so I'm going to try. As someone who deeply loves music (and plays it), I hear an unbelievable number of songs, many of them featuring the same five chords, the same strumming pattern on the same acoustic guitar, the same diatonic melodies. Yet in some of these songs there is some kind of magic that lifts them above all other songs. It feels like pins and needles and it quickens my heart. I've heard it in everything from Henry Threadgill (\"Silver and Gold, Baby, Silver and Gold\") to CCR (\"Lodi\") to Al Green (\"I'm a Ram\") to The Walkmen (\"The New Year\"), and I hear it inÂ <strong>The Wailing Wall</strong>.\r\n\r\nDavid Foster Wallace once spoke of an epiphanicÂ <em>â€œclickâ€</em>Â he heard while reading the very best fiction (he took the word from a Yeats poem which features a line about<em>Â â€œthe click of a well-made boxâ€</em>), something instinctually felt but impossible to explain, and something that is curiously absent from some of the most outwardly skillful writing (Updike, in his example). To steal another phrase from Wallace,Â <strong>The Wailing Wall</strong>Â <em>â€œclicks like a fucking geiger counter.â€</em>Â They always make those tired old chords sound like something you've never heard before.\r\n\r\nThe band's Ampeater single is no exception to this rule, featuring a bouncy and wonderfully catchy non-album tune entitledÂ <strong>\"The Words We Choose\"</strong>Â and an alternate version of the lovely and darkÂ <strong>\"Hospital Blossom\"</strong>. \"The Words We Choose\" is the danciest thing I've ever heard come out ofÂ <strong>The Wailing Wall</strong>, but it works far better than what you are probably imagining in your head right now after all that talk about death and spirituality. The casio and handclap percussion and accordion drones that kick off the song immediately call to mind Paul Simon's \"Graceland\" and the way the vocals are buried neck-deep in the huge swells of accordion chords would make me want to say something like acoustic shoegaze if that weren't kind of thing that makes me want to slap music writers, so never mind. Anyway, try not to bob your head up and down. Also try not to walk around for the rest of the day singingÂ <em>â€œWhere has my heart gone? Whoa-oh-oh.â€</em>Â It's impossible. The moment (1:28) when the banjo and glockenspiel and harmonica enter and the tambourine starts playing full-time instead of doubling the backbeat sounds to me like the sun coming out from behind the clouds. In other words, it clicks.\r\n\r\nThe much sparser demo version ofÂ <strong>\"Hospital Blossom\"</strong>Â drops the percussion and brings the vocals to the fore, swathed in ghostly singing saw. The lyrics about highways running down wrists seem to nod to Leonard Cohen's \"Dress Rehearsal Rag\", and the stark arrangement illustrates just how well the song stands up even without the dramatic arrangement that fills out the album version. The melody fits so naturally over the simple fingerpicking (the exact pattern that Cohen uses on every single waltz) and the almost classical sounding rhyme of the lyrics is well-served by the exposure.Â <em>â€œI know there's no light found in songs that I sing,â€</em>Â he sings, and I only hope he knows how untrue that is.",

		"content" : "Since dropping on Philadelphia's thriving experimental music scene in 2006, these virtuosos have already compiled a beefy resume. A grant from the American Composers Forum, a slot at John Zorn's The Stone, legions of fist-pumping fans. But the real accomplishment comes in the form of their music.Â <strong>Normal Love</strong>Â packs an incredible amount of musical diversity into their compositions, making the clichÃ© of postmodern pastiche too weak a descriptor. Plus, we're not talking about some guy huddled over a laptop and dropping nostalgia-bomb after nostalgia-bomb by just glitch-quilting his whole record collection. Nay, we're talking real artful synthesis of deliciously obscure influences, from death metal to satanic funk to West African minimalism toâ€¦umâ€¦the boss music from Contra.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side \"Severe Confection\"</strong>Â draws heavily from the interval-hopping style of bourgeois-shocking dissonance. If it isnâ€™t serialism, itâ€™s damn close. Also worth noting is that \"Confection\" was penned by Dustin Hurt, brains behind the excellent Philadelphia experimental music non-profit Bowerbird. If youâ€™re tired of grinding, atonal chords and a total abuse of the metrical form, I hear you. But itâ€™s the gentle shift of predictable expressive forms that saves this band from sameness. Take midpoint of \"Severe Confection.\" After several minutes of rhythmic acrobatics with notes practically suffocating the aural space, a pregnant pause emerges, almost awkwardly bare. For a moment, you think theyâ€™ve cleverly pulled the plug, given us the olâ€™ getâ€™em when they least expect it. And then, rising out of the silence, a slowly growing chord of male voices, groaning more than singing, and thenâ€”wham! Three more minutes of skronk. A severe confection, indeed.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s moments like that that makeÂ <strong>Normal Love</strong>Â easy to, well, love. You can marvel at their technical prowess (which is, to say the least, daunting) or the jaw-dropping complexity of their compositions, but youâ€™ll be missing the whole picture. As bassistÂ <strong>Evan Lipson</strong>Â once put it,Â <em>â€œeverybody always comes up to us after shows and are like, â€˜Whoa what was that chord you guys were playing? Was that a [insert very academic chord]?â€™ But itâ€™s not at all about that.â€</em>Â Truer words have never been spoken. Hereâ€™s a band that mixes its musical progress with playfulness, joy, intensity, humor, and a restless hunger for new combinations. Sure, if you go see Normal Love youâ€™re going to see a bunch of guys hunched over practically pitch-black sheet music. But youâ€™ll also see them do it passionately with smiles on their faces and witty crowd banter. Plus, youâ€™ll be surrounded by a bunch of drunk hipsters in someoneâ€™s living room. Carnegie Hall this ainâ€™t.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"Ndugo\"</strong>Â (whose title I hope, but havenâ€™t confirmed, is a reference to Jack Nicholsonâ€™s African pen-pal in \"About Schmidt\") really underscoresÂ <strong>Normal Loveâ€™s</strong>Â playful side. The onslaught of muted plucks in the beginning verges on silly without losing its access to the realm of the awesome. Throw in an unexpected dynamic explosion, a VarÃ¨se-like siren glissando on the violin and skittering snare rims, and weâ€™re getting into some truly bizarre shit.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, liberatingÂ <em>\"difficult\"</em>Â music from the confines of the academe is no small feat. There are probably plenty of over-educated detractors out there who would object to<strong>Â Normal Loveâ€™s</strong>Â lighthearted approach to the avant-garde, just as there are probably plenty of Zs fans (or former members, rumor has it) who canâ€™t believe that such serious music should be sharing bills with a bunch of Nuggets-worshipping art-school dropouts with asymmetrical haircuts. The difference, of course, is that Zs is deadly serious, whereas Normal Love brings something else to the head table. Itâ€™s called heart.",

		"content" : "Providence-based singerÂ <strong>Rosalind Schonwald</strong>Â is my Model Martian Moon Girl and here's whyâ€¦ She's got a great voice and sings with remarkable maturity for a nineteen year old. Well versed in both jazz and classical music, she approaches pop with a strong theoretical background, but she isn't too haughty to have a little fun with it. Her music is accessible but intriguing enough to warrant repeat listens. And while her lyrics are superficially cute and clever, they don't shy away from heavier topics. Consider the A-Side, a love song for a non-existentÂ <strong>\"Model Martian Moon Boy.\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Schonwald</strong>Â claims that the refrain,Â <em>â€œYouâ€™re my Model Martian Moon Boy,â€</em>Â is nonsensical, but beneath the silliness she questions the danger of dependency.\r\n\r\n<em>Oh, when you finally find yourself under all those good intentions\r\nI want you for myself in a way Iâ€™d rather not mention</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Youâ€™re the armor that protects meâ€¦\r\nAnd Iâ€™ll keep you if it wrecks me</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Schonwald</strong>Â alternates between the hyper-metaphorical and the specific, so the listener never knows exactly what imagery to expect.\r\n\r\n<em>Right now youâ€™re the treetops that sweetly grace the stars\r\nRight now you have the only shoulders I want to lean on.</em>\r\n\r\nHer controlled vibrato on the high notes conveys a sense of ambiguity, both the power and vulnerability that love offer.\r\n\r\nClocking in at nearly seven minutes,Â <strong>\"Model Martian Moon Boy\"</strong>Â isnâ€™t exactly a radio hit. There is so little harmonic variation that with a few small cuts the song could be reduced to three minutes. But itâ€™s no accident thatÂ <strong>Schonwald</strong>Â allows it stretch on luxuriously. She delivers her lyrics deliberately but slowly, so that you never know quite when the end of the phrase is going to fall. Surrender and enjoy the lullaby.\r\n\r\n<strong>Schonwald</strong>Â wroteÂ <strong>â€œHelenâ€™s Songâ€</strong>Â about her grandmother. Although thematically quite different fromÂ <strong>â€œModel Martian Moon Boy,â€</strong>Â Schonwald explains,Â <em>â€œI conceived of both of them as a series of images within a world with fantastical properties while I wrote them. My grandmother never sat in her living room yanking a chain relating to fate, and I've never seen a treetop graze a star, let alone making contact with one, but in both cases I found the creation of such imagery to be a very real and concrete release of emotion.â€</em>Â Real emotion behind the fantasy.\r\n\r\n<em>Her mind stays sharp but her body is breaking\r\nAlways giving never taking\r\nItâ€™s preposterous to me\r\nHow she could cease to be\r\nI canâ€™t see I canâ€™t hardly believe</em>\r\n\r\nUntil the refrain, the music is repressed, tense, sparse, and hesitant. But in the last minute of the recording,Â <strong>Schonwald</strong>Â builds into a powerful and uplifting bluesy progression.\r\n\r\n<em>Youâ€™ll see that she is flying, sheâ€™s flying, there she goesâ€¦</em>\r\n\r\nHer voice soars along with the lyrics, and when she finally returns to the beginning theme, itâ€™s with a heightened sense of awareness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Schonwald</strong>Â is often compared to Regina Spektor and itâ€™s easy to see why. They have similar voices, play the piano, are heavily influenced by jazz, and share a penchant for quirky lyrics. If you like Regina, particularly her earlier work, youâ€™ll probably like Rosalind Schonwald. But letâ€™s not dismiss Rosalind Schonwald as a mere Regina Spektor imitation, even though that wouldnâ€™t be such a terrible thing. Schonwaldâ€™s style is more minimalist than Spektorâ€™s. She avoids conventional song structure, preferring to take things slowly, allowing her songs to develop at a relaxed pace. She doesnâ€™t over-complicate and she doesnâ€™t dumb it downâ€¦ and the result is something really pleasant. She could be a hit in any coffee shop from Brooklyn to Timbuktu!",

		"content" : "<strong>Tres Coronas</strong>Â was formed in early 2004 by students at one of America's most elite boarding schools. Surprising? Well, perhaps it is, but in a way it makes perfect sense. Without Stalin could there have been a Mandelstam a Bulgokov? Without the Vietnam War, could there have been a Woodstock? Maybe I'm getting a bit carried away with my metaphors, but the point I'm trying to make is that often art is reactionary. What use is rebellion without something to rebel against? And so it came to be that Tres Coronas, one of the edgiest bands out there, was born in a stuffy and sterile environment.\r\n\r\nThe energetic 3-piece featuresÂ <strong>Thomas McDonell</strong>Â on vocals and guitar,Â <strong>Jeremy Beecher</strong>Â on bass, andÂ <strong>Jami Makan</strong>Â on drums. Front man McDonell is the driving force behind the band. He wrote most of the band's material alone, then brought his sketches into the practice room where Beecher and Makan flushed them out with a bit of their own flavor.\r\n\r\nThe nameÂ <strong>Tres Coronas</strong>Â is a nod toÂ <strong>Beecher's</strong>Â hometown Corona del Mar, California and also a clear reference toÂ <em>la cerveza mas fina</em>Â (underage drinking was an offense worthy of probation).\r\n\r\nTheir music is filled with fiery adolescent spirit.Â <strong>A-side \"Sick Parade\"</strong>Â comes from their self titled EP, recorded during their boarding school days on shoddy equipment in a tiny music practice room. Needless to say, it isn't a hallmark of high fidelity. There's some pretty heavy clipping on the drum fills and the cymbals crash with so much force that they were jokingly dubbed theÂ <em>â€œdeath gongâ€</em>Â by the band. But it's hard to imagine howÂ <strong>Tres Coronas</strong>Â could have recorded a more perfect album. The lo-fi aesthetic meshes beautifully with their raw and punchy attitude.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Sick Parade\"</strong>Â is a punk anthem. And in traditional punk fashion, it's practically impossible to make out the words. A few key phrases emerge from the dustâ€¦. control, girls, alone. But I'll be honest; I've listened to this recording dozens of times and I still have no idea whatÂ <strong>McDonell</strong>Â is saying. His voice exudes sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll. You don't need to understand the words to feel the attitude. This isn't incredibly nuanced music. It's three musicians beating the shit out of their instruments. And they do it better than almost anyone. Although the result is raw, it's never sloppy.Â <strong>Makan's</strong>Â fills are crisp, hits are in perfect unison, and McDonell's singing (erâ€¦ screeching?) is spot on. It's one thing to achieve precision in the studio but it's another thing to achieve it live, and \"Sick Parade\" is essentially a live take.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"The Horror\"</strong>Â revealsÂ <strong>Tres Coronas</strong>Â at a very different stage in their musical and psychological development.Â  The track was recording during a one week recording session in Trinidad, California on the northern shores of the Pacific Ocean. The result is 3-track EP with a surprisingly relaxed vibe. The change is almost as pronounced as their change in location, as shocking as the difference between snowy New England and the sunny California beach, and this difference is epitomized by \"The Horror\", the first cut from their â€œTrinidadâ€ session.\r\n\r\nWhereasÂ <strong>A-side \"Sick Parade\"</strong>Â is extremely concise,Â <strong>\"The Horror\"</strong>Â stretches on lazily. At 4:36, it's a full thirty seconds longer than the longest cut off their first EP. The band is in no rush, and why should they be when it's so damned nice outside? The recording quality is undoubtedly better too, by which I mean less abrasive, although I must confess that I miss theÂ <em>â€œdeath gongâ€</em>Â and clipping.\r\n\r\nUnlikeÂ <strong>\"Sick Parade\"</strong>, this is the kind of song you can sing along with after one listenâ€¦\r\n\r\n<em>â€œI'm not gonna waste my time</em>\r\n<em>Loving you means something more</em>\r\n<em>I swear, I swearâ€</em>\r\n\r\nThe pre-chorus will probably catch you by surprise the first time around. The reflective verse is interrupted by crashing drums and a blaring B-3 organ. But the second time around it seems a bit more congruous. And when the final chorus hits, the song falls together and soars onto a new plane.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œThe horror of loveâ€¦â€</em>\r\n\r\nIt's one of those catchy ironic refrains that can repeat indefinitely. In this case, it only goes on for a minute, but it feels like three. A bluesy organ solo fromÂ <strong>Beecher</strong>Â sneaks in at the end. Those four uplifting chords (conventional as they may be) capture all the highs and lows of love, the horror but also the hope. And above all, they're brutally catchy.\r\n\r\nSo is thisÂ <strong>Tres Coronas</strong>Â reinventing themselves as a pop band?Â <strong>\"The Horror\"</strong>Â is certainly a stylistic leap, but it's still very much a Tres Coronas song.Â <strong>McDonell's</strong>Â voice retains its characteristic bad-ass punch but adopts a more melodic quality.Â <strong>Makan's</strong>Â machine gun fills find their place in the mix, just not so loud. Sometimes a band needs that one soft song in their set. This is that song.\r\n\r\nToday,Â <strong>Tres CoronasÂ </strong>is quasi-defunct. The trio is spread across the country, so they don't have much time to gig. They only reunite for the occasional show or recording session.Â  I've listened to their complete works so many times that were they on vinyl, they'd have been reduced to a pile of dust long ago. Luckily, they're on MP3 so I can keep going back for more. And if the band is reading this now, I'd like to remind them that they still have at least one dedicated listener ready to greet any new material with open ears.",

If the lyric, especially, isn't finished quickly, a song can linger on unfinished for years; I'll get sick of it, and get stuck unless I can move on to the next one. So it's better for me to have a short lyric and a short tune that I can tie up quickly in an afternoon, then mix over the next week or so in little shots, and stick a fork in it and call it done.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Royâ€™s</strong>Â lyrics are intelligent and a bit off kilter.Â  Theyâ€™re often edgy but he also has a sensitive side, and isnâ€™t afraid to appeal to it.Â Â <strong>A-side \"Shiny Dark Bar\"</strong>Â concludes\r\n\r\n<em>You look like shit but you feel like a star\r\nGet out of your head in the shiny dark bar\r\nI accept you for who you are\r\nSo lay down your guard in the shiny dark bar\r\nI'll kiss your face if you lead me that far\r\nLet's keep it right here in the shiny dark bar\r\nGive up your keys and forget your car\r\nAnd lay down your head on the shiny dark bar</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Royâ€™s</strong>Â voice has just the right amount of attitude.Â  Itâ€™s whiny when it should be whiny, smooth when it should be smooth.Â  Vocals are supported by crunchy guitars and drum machine.Â  The lush harmonies that come in at the extended chorus offer a nice repose from the heavier verse.\r\n\r\nOnÂ <strong>B-side \"The New Red Scare\"</strong>,Â <strong>Roy</strong>Â demonstrates a penchant for sarcasm and rebellion reminiscent of early punk, which perhaps isnâ€™t so surprising since he was a teenager at the time bands like The Ramones and The Clash were starting to blow up.\r\n\r\n<em>Hide your pistols and hide your grandma, Census bureau's\r\nHere comes another load of shit, stinks to heaven and it fills the streets\r\nIt commands our attention and it keeps our asses in the seats\r\nOr so they seem to think but\r\nSomeone's screaming\r\nThat the commies are coming\r\nThat they'll take all our money\r\nAnd if you believe that, I got a bridge to sell ya...</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>\"The New Red Scare\"</strong>Â is a whopping one minute and twenty-two seconds long.Â  Perhaps thatâ€™s taking the whole short and snappy thing a little too far.Â  But it leaves this listener wanting more, and when two listens clock in at less than three minutes, repeat listens are easy to justify.Â  Simply while writing the last two paragraphs, I made it through 5 consecutive listens.Â  Iâ€™m about to go for six.Â  Already I fear that Iâ€™ll be up all night singing along.\r\n\r\nAccording toÂ <strong>Roy</strong>, both tracks are merely demos.Â  His greatest hit is probablyÂ <strong>Paper Valentines</strong>Â which, incidentally, is soon to become a play along chart on Rock Band.Â  But he choseÂ <strong>\"Shiny Dark Bar\"</strong>Â andÂ <strong>\"The New Red Scare\"</strong>Â over some of his more polished material because they are what heâ€™s working on at the moment.Â  And perhaps thatâ€™s why Royâ€™s music seems so real.Â  After almost thirty years, heâ€™s still living in the moment, always creating something new.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

		"content" : "You, dear reader (hopefully you're out there somewhere), may be surprised to see me penning a review of a pop band. I can't blame you. Then again,Â <strong>Twin Sister</strong>Â is no average pop band. I first saw these guys opening for Megafaun at the Silent Barn last spring. Since then, my support for them has been unwavering, my praise of them hyperbolic to the extreme. Towards the end of the show, the battering chorus ofÂ <strong>\"Ginger\"</strong>Â made me blurt out that this band was the Weezer of the 21<sup>st</sup>Â Century. Granted, Weezer is still a band in the 21<sup>st</sup>Â Century (sort of), but that subject is too painful for me to pursue. I wasn't linking them up with the embarrassingly unselfconscious goofballs behind \"Beverly Hills\" and Raditude. I was thinking of the endearing nerds who threw pure pop genius in the face of the dominant grunge and alternative rock paradigms. This was almost certainly the whiskey talking, but there's an element of truth to my dumb declaration. Twin Sister are a true pop band's pop band. There may not be any overt innovations in their music, but it's so well conceived, so well crafted and, most importantly, so well executed that you'd be foolish not to give their music a serious listen.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œGingerâ€</strong>Â is a crash-course on everything the band does well. It starts off with a wave of texture so simultaneously diaphanous and huge it feels like U2 hallucinating in a cathedral. Insistent drums pound out a simple rhythm on toms and snare, a tinny acoustic guitar creeps stealthily in the left headphone, a beautifully cheap keyboard holds down the bass line. Itâ€™s the element of restraint that makes the track so successful. The marriage of sophisticated textures with streamlined structures makes for an irresistible hypnotic thrust. By the time the guitar stabs creep in towards the end of the verse, youâ€™re almost paralyzed by bliss. Finally the curtain draws back, revealing a chorus like a wave of melodic reverb. At times it sounds like bouncy guitar pop of the Smiths slowed down to the speed of a slow-moving liquid. In a word: heavenly. They wisely ride out the chorus to victory, throwing in a beautiful guitar solo and a goosebump-inducing harmony of the wordsÂ <em>â€œI love you.â€</em>Â If it sounds corny on paper, get thee to a listening station and revel in great popâ€™s transformation of the familiar into the unfamiliar.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œI Want a Houseâ€</strong>Â goes for drier sonic territory.Â <em>â€œI want a house built of old wood,â€</em>Â intones Andrea Estella.Â <em>â€œYou can paint it any color you like, so long as I can live with you.â€</em>Â At once naÃ¯ve and calculatingly obsessive, this simple request becomes haunting when paired with a quiet tom-pattern and a ringing, sitar-like keyboard tone. FollowingÂ <strong>â€œGinger,â€</strong>Â the tune gradually adds subtle textureâ€”some quiet bells here, a chorus of staggered voices thereâ€”before milking the foundational groove for all itâ€™s worth. The latter half of the song is simply badass, almost reminiscent of a less junkie-bummed Sly Stone. Dare I say, funky?\r\n\r\nI spoke with guitarist and voxmanÂ <strong>Eric Cardona</strong>Â about the history and future of the band.Â <em>â€œWe've been together one year and a half, but have been wanting to do this for about 5 years. We were always in different bands, and were each others favorite members. Our main influences range from many different things- all of our friends, John K. especially.....Kate Bush, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Cocteau Twins, CAN,Â  Hayao Miyazaki movies, Cats (not the play, we really really love our cats), Roy Orbison, things like that. Our new EP, Aquarellas, will hopefully be done before the new year, we've been working very hard on it. We started out very into our recordings, but balancing that out and getting tight with more sexual live performances is our next move, playing lots of shows, etc. In the next phase of us we hope to become better at being a band.â€</em>",

		"content" : "The biggest question asked by the music ofÂ <strong>Shark?</strong>Â is, well, Shark? No, seriously, this is pretty straightforward business, albeit masterfully made, with an expansive, almost theoretical understanding of whatÂ <em>\"indie rock\"</em>Â could mean in an era when that term has become practically meaningless. So, regardless of how, I don't know, not-new-in terms of synth wobbles, cut-up drums, faux-afro flavor, fu*k it, evenÂ <em>compression</em>-Shark? sound, that reactionary aesthetic, here appropriated with live instruments the way other bands mine Max MSP, is very interesting indeed.\r\n\r\nWhy? BecauseÂ <strong>Shark?</strong>Â (from Brooklyn) proves that there is such a thing as anÂ <em>â€œindieâ€</em>Â sound that has nothing to do with actualÂ <em>â€œindie-pendenceâ€</em>, that the accidental aesthetic of basement productions of the 80s and 90s has become dislocated from the conditions of their production. What we have here is pure simulacrum, the sign (rock) dissociated from its signified (filth, 4-Tracks, etc.) to make way for an â€œindie rockâ€ that is nothing but sound signifying itself.\r\n\r\nSnore. But really, itâ€™s worth noting how this pattern has been unfolding across the pop-music consciousness of America since, letâ€™s say, The Strokes (and by the Strokes, I donâ€™t specifically mean the Strokes, but thatÂ <em>whole idea</em>Â of the Strokes). Not that â€œindieâ€ is a new term. I remember that shit on my amazon.com wishlist when I was 8 and not knowing what it meant. Still, â€œindieâ€, at some point, must have meant â€œindependentâ€, as in, not â€œindependent-y sounding musicâ€, but independence from major labels, playing nasty, hepatitis-C-infected living rooms, breaking strings and selling your shoes for new ones, the van blowing a tire in Topeka, and a bunch of other stuff I could make up. â€œIndieâ€ wasnâ€™t a way to play, it was an economic situation that necessitated a way of playing. Do I sound like an old dude? Iâ€™m not complaining. Itâ€™s just I have to believe that â€œindieâ€ was a real thing before it was a genre, just like there was an â€œindustrial revolutionâ€ before there was industrial music.\r\n\r\nBut back toÂ <strong>Shark?</strong>. I love this band. Their record sounds great! They have incredible songs, great craft, a thick sound that Iâ€™d be psyched to see live. It sounds like some undiscovered 1976 gem of a single dug up in the way back of the last surviving CD store in Minneapolisâ€™s going-out-of business sale. Kind of. Or it could be from Sweden. Thatâ€™s the whole point. Wherever these guys are from, the music is place-less, scene-less, history-less while at the same time evoking perfectly someplace, some scene, some fraught and cool history.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œIâ€™m an Animal,â€</strong>Â has my new favorite comeback. In response to the title, the singer, on the second verse, rebuts, in a dead-eyed, crackly voice,Â <em>â€œYouâ€™re a mineral.â€</em>Â Brilliant! Letâ€™s talk about this. The song kicks off with some shambolic hi-hats, then a big organ swell, then some staccato guitars, meaty-bass, echo-y, tinny vocals. Itâ€™s pitch-perfect in its imperfections, like a cheese-filled with delicious fungus and covered in holes. Yada-yada, the tune continues. Then, out of left-field comes this warbly, crazy-flute synth, somewhere between â€œMy Heart Will Go Onâ€ and MGMT (wait, is there â€œsomewhere betweenâ€ those two things?). Itâ€™s a killer riff. But what is it? The singer knows. If verse one was the animal, verse two is the mineral.\r\n\r\nThe second trackÂ <strong>â€œColder Arabellaâ€</strong>, a slightly-renamed cover, apparently, of another Brooklyn band calledÂ <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/dinosaurfeathers\" target=\"_blank\">Dinosaur Feathersâ€™s</a>Â tune called â€œCold Arabella,â€ drives the disconnect home. While the titling is amusing, itâ€™s also a seemingly out-of-place nod to remix culture: Dinosaur Feathers's is cold, but this shit isÂ <em>colder</em>! Iâ€™d believe it. The track, dry, fuzzed-out, deadpan, a little out of tune, is so anonymous it could have been produced autonomously from a sentient version of the 1984 SST catalog. Itâ€™s chilly, not like steel girders in February, but like circuits in cold storage.\r\n\r\nWhat we have inÂ <strong>Shark?</strong>Â is a question without an answer, where the unanswerability of the question (where, when, who) makes the band unique and specific. Shark? could only exist now, whenever now happens to be.",

		"content" : "<em>\"I'm gonna walk / down the sidewalk / like it's a runway / â€¦ / I'm gonna be like Madonna\"</em>\r\n<strong>We Are Soldiers We Have Guns</strong>,Â Â <em>November</em>\r\n\r\nI've just moved to New York City, and it's just turned to November, and I have to say that I admire the attitude of those lyrics.Â  When it starts getting darker earlier, and everyone's bundled up in patterned scarves and heavy coats, the sidewalk starts to feel a bit lonely-I'd very much love to be like Madonna walking home from work some days.\r\n\r\n<strong>We Are Soldiers We Have Guns</strong>Â may exist for just such times.Â  The Gothenburg (Sweden, for all those not down with maps) based pop vehicle brings a sharp attack of straight-forward, honest lyricism with some surprisingly upbeat arrangements. This lushness is the product of the mind of Gothenburgâ€™sÂ <strong>Malin Dahlberg</strong>, formerly ofÂ <strong>Douglas Heart</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Laurel Music</strong>, joined by a wide circle of instrument-wielding accomplices.\r\n\r\nOne could argue that the major musical accomplishment of the 1980s was to re-inject popular music with a sense of fun and excitement.Â  Pop rediscovered that sense of child-like wonder that rock and roll had so foolishly squandered while trying to sound cool.Â  Colorful clothing, silly faces, etc.Â  Try to imagine the 80s without picturing a bunch of teenagers dancing around a library.Â  See? You canâ€™t.\r\n\r\nThe most recent decade of pop, on the other hand, has excelled at incorporating the sonic mastery and precision of experimental and progressive music into the pop framework.Â  Albums soundÂ <em>great</em>Â now.Â  Modern luminaries like Animal Collective and Radiohead continue to score points by breeding sonic exploration with the pop we all know and love.\r\n\r\nYouâ€™ll findÂ <strong>We Are Soldiers We Have Guns</strong>Â at the intersection of these two decadesâ€”the undeniable fun and sounds of the 80s permeate the music, especially theÂ <strong>\"November\"/\"Our Lips Are Sealed\" 7-inchÂ </strong>below.Â  Beneath that, however, is the careful sonic craft of this most recent decade of pop.Â  Thereâ€™s real attention paid to toneâ€”<strong>Dahlbergâ€™s</strong>Â voice in particular stands out as being spot on tonally nearly all of the time.Â  Grand, multi-layered voicings back up the strong bridges and choruses, while un-layered vocals fill out the softer moments.Â  Like M83 before them,Â <strong>WASWHG</strong>Â have learned how to pull from the 80s without sounding wistfulâ€”to use their influences as a boost, not a crutch.\r\n\r\nOn their early work, thereâ€™s a progressive sparseness that drives the power of each track.Â  Much of the best work on two self-titled E.P.s and the mini album,Â <strong>To Meet is Murder</strong>Â is powered by the interplay between a lonely guitar andÂ <strong>Dahlbergâ€™sÂ </strong>evocative vocals.Â Â <em>\"There's no need for diplomacy in music,\"</em>Â says Dahlberg,Â <em>\"For every instrument I/we use I ask myself: Would the song be good without this? If the answer is yes, I never use it.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThat attitude is quite apparent.Â  With their newest release,Â <strong>Get Up, Get Out</strong>, and on the lovely 7-inch we have on display here,Â <strong>WASWHG</strong>Â really flex their well honed 80s muscle while retaining the simple power of their early work.Â  Gone are the sparse guitar-centered arrangements, replaced instead with fuller-yet-no-less-intense pop layouts.\r\n\r\nTake theÂ <strong>A-side \"November\"</strong>Â for example.Â  This is an emotionally sneaky track; the opening strokes lead the listener down the path of a groovy polyrhythmic synth piece.Â  When the vocals and guitar interrupt, the mood changes subtly to a more poignant pitch, only to be joined back by the keyboard and drums in the lead up to and joyful chorus.Â  \"<em>Iâ€™m gonna be like Madonna,\"</em>Â <strong>Dahlberg</strong>Â sings.Â  Madonna had this much fun, but rarely was she as emotionally on-cue as Dahlberg is here, squeaking her way through the tip-toeing verses and soaring over the joyous chorus.\r\n\r\nTheÂ <strong>B-side \"Our Lips Are Sealed\"</strong>Â is a cover of the 1981 Go-Goâ€™s track, and really, this is a clever, clever re-imagination.Â Â <strong>WASWHG</strong>Â have adorned the track with trappings of the soon-to-be-80s that bands like the Go-Goâ€™s helped create.Â  Where there were only the plodding 70s-style rhythm keeping,Â <strong>WASWHG</strong>Â have added some reverby drum machine hits worthy of any Casio-loving 80s band.Â  A few well-placed synth lines later, and you forget that theÂ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3kQlzOi27M\" target=\"_blank\">original</a>Â didnâ€™t sound quite like this.Â  The modern touches are there as wellâ€”the beautifully layered vocals and heightened melody of the chorus givesÂ <strong>WASWHGâ€™s</strong>Â version a contemporary tenderness not entirely present in the original.Â  So, to recap:Â  cleverly plays with the musicâ€™s history; captures its original essence; adds a modern touch.Â  Yep, this is a great cover.\r\n\r\n<strong>WASWHG</strong>Â wrote once on their website,Â <em>\"We Are Soldiers We Have Guns will never be cool; never be cute.\"</em>Â While I disagree slightly (SeeÂ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xICpAzE35ks\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>.Â  You canâ€™t tell me thatâ€™s not cute), the notion is spot on:Â  this is music that does not pretend to be anything other than direct expression from artist to audience.Â Â <em>\"I don't change my words just because they're put into lyrics,\"</em>Â saysÂ <strong>Dahlberg</strong>.Â Â <em>\"I use them as simply as possible, just as I do when I speak.\"</em>Â Thereâ€™s no indie-pretension or shameless image shaping, just sounds that move beyond their source to live wholly in the song.Â  And that makes this nothing short of urgent, beautiful pop music worthy of your attention.\r\n<h3>Interview:</h3>\r\n<strong>Ampeater Review:</strong>Â I suspect that people are surprised when they discover,Â <strong>We Are Soldiers We Have Guns</strong>Â isn't a hardcore punk band.Â  So, why theÂ <em>\"aggressive\"</em>Â name and how do you think it interacts with the sound and tone of your music?\r\n\r\n<strong>Malin Dahlberg, We Are Soldiers We Have Guns:</strong>Â Some are definitely surprised, yeah. To me that name sort of shows how you can make hard music without the usual clichÃ©s. You know: lots of guitars, lots of screaming and lots of jumping up and down. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not what I want to do. I wanted a name that sounds empowering, uncompromising and, well, pretty hardcore. To me those are pretty important sides of my music that I think a lot of people miss out on because of the traditionally un-aggressive expression.\r\n\r\n<strong>AR:Â </strong>Which aspects of your sound then have you tried to make uncompromising?Â  Lyrics and simplicity of tone jump to my mind first, but I'm curious to hear your take.\r\n\r\n<strong>MD:Â </strong>For instance, takeÂ <strong>\"The Line is a Dot to You\"</strong>Â (it's on my Myspace for those who want to hear it). The song is about this horrible guy that I met once, and instead of singing,Â <em>\"I'm a bit angry with you,\"</em>Â I sing,Â <em>\"We will aim and shoot you down.â€</em>Â In reality I didn't even approach him, but in the song I can kill him off if I want to! There's no need for diplomacy in music, so I'm doing my best to keep it out of mine. It could be by simplicity or lyrics - I just try to keep an uncompromising attitude towards everything that has something to do with my music.\r\n\r\n<strong>AR:</strong>Â I noticed that all three of your music videos involve, in some way, you looking directly at the camera for long periods of time.Â  Whether that's all a lovely coincidence or not, it does seem that your songs are concerned with being really direct with the listener?Â  Would you agree?\r\n\r\n<strong>MD:Â </strong>I actually haven't thought about the fact that I do so in the videos, I don't know why that is. But definitely agree on the soldiers being direct. I don't change my words just because they're put into lyrics. I use them as simply as possible, just as I do when I speak. And for every instrument I/we use I ask myself: Would the song be good without this? If the answer is yes, I never use it.\r\n\r\n<strong>AR:Â </strong>You can definitely hear the influence of 80s pop, especially in the new full length.Â  What do you like about pop music from that decade and what 80s pop elements have found their way into your recordings?\r\n\r\n<strong>MD:Â </strong>I don't set out to sound like an eighties band or anything, but on the other hand it would be weird if my music wasn't at least a little bit affected by the eighties. I grew up during the eighties, and now I've gotten old enough to appreciate it again. I listen quite lot to disco from the late seventies - early eighties and I love post punk bands such as Delta 5, The Au-Pairs and (obviously) The Go-Go's.Â  I really like the tackiness, the limitless use of effects and funny synth sounds.\r\n\r\n<strong>AR:</strong>Â Can you talk a bit about the songs you're tracking right now?Â  In what ways do the songs feel similar or different fromÂ <strong>Get Up, Get Out</strong>?Â  I'm also curious what it's like recording in Brooklyn vs. Gothenburg.\r\n\r\n<strong>MD:</strong>Â The new bunch of songs go under the working titleÂ <strong>Payday</strong>. To me the biggest difference between recording in Brooklyn and Gothenburg is that I don't have a job over here and can finally get the peace one needs to do something creative. That's also what a lot of the songs are about: The way everybody works their life away without ever getting properly paid back.\r\n\r\nI don't really know what the songs sound like compared toÂ <strong>Get Up, Get Out</strong>, but telling you about the setting might give you an idea:Â <strong>Get Up, Get Out,</strong>Â was recorded in a studio with about 15 people contributing. I record the new songs alone on my laptop, using only an old Casiosynth that I bought in a Swedish thrift store and the stuff that I find on the streets. So no guitars on these tracks, but a lot more drumming on boxes and furniture from the streets of Brooklyn!\r\n\r\n<strong>AR:Â </strong>Final question, very important: 1980s vs. 2000s.Â  Which decade's music wins in a bar fight?\r\n\r\n<strong>MD:Â </strong>Let me put it this way: The 80s would definitely win the fight, but 2000s is most likely to go home with the best looking guy/girl in the place. While the 2000s is whimsing around with its post-this and ironic takes on that, the 80s would just give her a nice head butt and call it a day. But while the 80s is drinking her eleventh beer by the bar, the 2000s is already at someoneâ€™s place talking about deep stuff while getting undressed.",

		"content" : "I won't do this too often, I promise, but I'd like to use the beginning of this review as an opportunity to climb up on my ethnomusicological soapbox and do some good ol' fashioned preaching. I've had this idea for a couple years now that YouTube is the next evolution of musical transmission, in so much as it's become a virtual substitute for the proverbial front porch banjo lesson. But, instead of sitting cross-legged on the wooden floor while your used-to-be-a-coal-miner-until-he-got-the-ol'-black-lung-don't-ya-know Grandpa walks you through the rudiments of how to play \"Darling Cora,\" you get to sit in your boxers, eating Chinese leftovers, and work your way note by note through \"StillJreming\"'s rendition ofÂ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU65z-lsL38\" target=\"_blank\">\"Trouble in Mind.\"</a>Â You savvy readers already know this, but the internet has really done much more for music than merely piss off Lars Ulrich and encourage 1TB hard drive sales; it's completely changed how music is passed down through generations. Teenage kids have just as much access to traditional blues and gospel tunes as they have to punk and rock, and this incredible confluence of influences is already leading to some wonderful things.Â  How else could an organic chemist in Indiana come to have 30,000 views on his YouTube video ofÂ \"Hard Time Killing Floor,\"Â and inspire a listener comment likeÂ <em>\"There's so much soul leaking from the guitar that you could harvest it, put it in mason jars then sell it for wholesale purchase with great bargains.\"</em>Â The great unveiling: StillJReming isÂ <strong>Jean-Rene Ella</strong>, and though I've never met the man, he taught me how to play guitar.\r\n\r\n<strong>Jean-Rene Ella</strong>Â is a citizen of the world in the truest sense. He grew up in Cameroon, Central Africa of a French-born mother and a father deeply moved by American blues and gospel. This alone is a recipe for musical success: African polyrhythm combined with the structure of traditional French folk tunes and the harmonic sense of the blues. Both parents were musical, and Ella began lessons on flute at the age of 4, moving first to piano and then finally guitar. For many years, his primary musical outlet was a small church gospel band, during which time he refined his musical sensibilities on the guitar, delving deeply into the tradition of the negro spiritual. In 1995 he moved to France and took up the role of singer and guitarist for a blues band calledÂ <strong>The Walkin' Chairs,Â </strong>who can be heard on Side A of this 7-inch. The group toured the North East of France until Ella left to pursue a PhD in chemistry in the United States. This marked the end of his ensemble career, and Ella's musical ventures have since been solo acts. For years he held a gig at a New Orleans establishment calledÂ \"The Neutral Ground Coffee House,\"Â but despite his musical inclinations, his scientific mind drew him into academia. By happenstance, during a vacation in France in 2007 a friend introduced Ella to YouTube and joked,Â <em>\"Hey, you can play that song so much better and share it online like that.\"</em>Â They laughed, his friend flipped on a video camera, and Ella did exactly that. Two years later, more people have heard Ella play his guitar and sing than can fit in Giants Stadium.\r\n\r\nWhen I contactedÂ <strong>Jean-Rene Ella</strong>Â about doing an Ampeater 7-inch, I wasn't too sure how he'd react. Was he a reclusive YouTube star like the renownedÂ Fretkillr, or would he be gracious enough to lend his talents to our modest little website? Well, Ella turns out to be as magnanimous a human being as he is a musician, and here we are with two studio recordings from a true master of his craft.Â Â <strong>Side A</strong>Â features Ella's groupÂ <strong>The Walkin' Chairs</strong>Â playing an original composition calledÂ <strong>\"Human River,\"</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Side B</strong>Â is an Ella solo performance of the traditional spiritualÂ <strong>\"Wade in the Water.\"</strong>Â \"Human River\" is a slow build with a deep groove. It's easy to talk about this tune like it's a blues spiritual for a new era, but it's not quite that. The Walkin' Chairs aren't mimicking or paying homage to a traditional genre. Instead, they're actually part of it, they're the real thing. There's pain in this music, there's introspection, and it belongs not to a single soul but to all of humanity. A solo guitar introduction gives way to a full band arrangement replete with string bass, drums, and one truly frenetic horn break. This tune might not grab some listeners--there's noÂ <em>\"hook.\"</em>Â The primary contrast is in Ella's voice, constantly changing in dynamic and timbre, reaching clear highs and deep growls. I love it, but if you're looking for something with a bit more apparent structure, then Side B is your thing.\r\n\r\nYou've probably heard this one before, performed by anyone fromÂ Marlena ShawÂ toÂ Bob Dylan.Â <strong>Jean-Rene Ella</strong>Â gives us his own fingerpicked rendition of this classic. He serves up both lead and harmony vocals, creating an effect akin to call and response that gives the tune a brilliant fullness. I was once told that there isn't 1, nor 2, nor 3, but 5 separate Michael Jackson vocal personas inÂ \"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough.\"Â This might have had more to do with Quincy Jones's enthusiastic production than with any sort of philosophical decision, but the idea is that each additional voice responds to the principle voice as a participant in the ongoing conversation of the song.Â <strong>\"Wade in the Water\"Â </strong>begins solo; a second voice enters in harmony on the refrainÂ <em>\"God's gonna trouble the water\"</em>; that same voice then departs and reacts to the chorus with subtle \"<em>ohoh\"</em>s. For the rest of the song it darts in and out, switching between harmony and counterpoint, leaving room for both Ellas to swim through the tune together, reacting and responding. Yeah, I know this is a little bitÂ <em>\"out there\"</em>Â for a music review, but when I listen to Ella's music, I sense something truly profound, something that asks me to listen just a bit more carefully than I otherwise might. There's no dissonance here, no odd effects, no incredible production, nothing to really set your ears aflame with curiosity, but maybe the plain facade and candid disposition of traditional music frees us to listen a bit deeper into what we're actually hearing and to grapple with it on a more fundamental level.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I leave you with some words from Ella himself:Â <em>\"I think that the original sound of work songs, negro spirituals and blues stayed with me because it felt so real. I'm not trying to sound cheesy or anything, but I could really feel the faith, or the pain or the joy in these songs, in that acoustic sound...something raw, unbiased, so I basically felt I had no choice. My heart and my mind wouldn't let me play the Blues or the Gospel any other way.\"</em>",

		"content" : "It would be easy to accuseÂ <strong>Cuddle Magic</strong>Â of being Luddites if only they weren't making music about a hundred times more interesting than all the panda cubs huddling in basements with SP-404s. I mean, samplers hell, these folks don't even use electric guitars. The thing is, while there is much fascinating and beautiful music to be made with samplers, for many people who adopt the instrument carelessly it becomes a crutch. When each button you press creates not just a note (with variations in attack, volume, etc.) but an entire complete sound, it's far easier to fill the aural space without much intention or thought. I think this is why it can actually take more skill to make great music on samplers: there are so many easy outs. When one loop sounds great, you have to actively disrupt it to create something new, whereas with acoustic instruments you have to literally play a repeated section every time. This may seem like splitting hairs but it makes a difference. It's the same kind of difference illustrated by the fact that it's easy to make deafening noise on an electric guitar and have the same absent expression on your face as someone adjusting the thermostat or reading page 712 of Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens, while making the same kind of noise on, say, the saxophone requires you to sweat torrentially and turn sunset red and stumble around like you're on whippets for the next 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThere is also the seemingly unavoidable issue that samplers put a choke collar on rhythm, restrict (and basically kill) harmony, and, in doing the latter, tie down melody as well. Person Pitch is a fantastic record partly because it transcends those restrictions, uses them as rungs on a ladder to something beautiful, but inherent to sampler-pop is monotony in everything but texture. To superimpose loops over one another, they music be harmonically simple (read: one chord, probably a triad) and rhythmically simple (all the same time signature [read:4/4]) to avoid clashes. When the song is a pyramid of loops built on one chord, the harmony never changes (see the entirety of Person Pitch), which means the melody (if the chord is, as suggested, a major or minor triad) is restricted to one diatonic scale. I mean most pop melodies are diatonic anyway, but interest is often spiked by inserting non-diatonic harmony underneath. And look at bands like Grizzly Bear or the Dirty Projectors. That shit is all about shifting rhythm and meter, bizarre harmony and non-diatonic melody.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cuddle Magic</strong>Â is just about the opposite of this, featuring twelve members, scattered all around Brooklyn and Philadelphia, most if not all of whom hold some sort of collegiate music degree and are masters of their instruments. What makes them great is not that they don't use samplers or amplification, it's that it would never occur to you while listening that there was anything missing. Every song is woven gorgeously together out of so many distinct sounds (all actual instruments played by actual human beings, if you're into that kind of thing) that the color palette, rather than being limited by the aversion to electrics and electronics, actually sounds significantly more varied and expansive than anything I've heard in quite a while. It's like the aural equivalent of the animation from Waking Life. The backbone of song is strong and clear, but the instruments filling it out are constantly shifting not only in terms of presence but in terms of timbre (ooh, music criticism word). Check out, for example, the banjo pattern that enters sneakily after the last chorus ofÂ <strong>A-side \"The Packaging\"</strong>, playing a hypnotic riff that actually does not line up with the rest of the band, intentionally creating a feeling that is both airy and tense. The arrangements here are impeccable, so perfect in their subtlety that it will take you minimum ten listens before you realize how brilliant they are.\r\n\r\nThese folks may avoid amplification but they embrace and understand experimentation. Clipped and percussive prepared piano is all overÂ <strong>B-side \"Paris/Happydent\"</strong>, strings lushly pad out the periphery ofÂ <strong>\"The Packaging\"</strong>, bass clarinet thickens and cools the warm upright bass sound or adds reedy weight to breathy vocals, vibraphone adds muted bell-tones to the vocal sections of \"Paris/Happydent\", contrapuntal vocals abound in both tunes, and meters are in constant flux. In fact, one of the most ravishing moments in the whole digital single is the first chorus to \"The Packaging\" in which the meter finally resolves into an even 6/8 and the male/female vocals are split into a round and set apart in achingly pretty yet elusive harmony. It's a resolution of sorts, butÂ <strong>Cuddle Magic</strong>Â always holds a little something back to keep you leaning forward.\r\n\r\nCheck out the start ofÂ <strong>\"Paris/Happydent\"</strong>Â (okay, yes, I know there are a few electronic elements here. Look, just shut up, I wanted to rant about samplers) where a jerky, atonal prepared piano riff is perfectly synced with punchy, crisp drums to build tension in a subtle and delicious way (that will also bob your head) until it finally breaks into the beautiful, dreamy, string-led 6/8 section. Music often sounds the most beautiful when you can't immediately recognize what is going on, andÂ <strong>Cuddle Magic</strong>Â thrives on that. This is pop music, don't get me wrong, but there's something elusive about all of it that just makes you want to put it on repeat, and when you do that and close your eyes, you feel like you are drifting into some other world. When the simple, pretty vocals finally kick in halfway through the track, after some vibraphone clusters and muted trumpet howls and string diads that combine to sound almost like a keyboard, they have a power that comes from the prior three minutes of searching. Purely experimental music gives you only the journey, experimental pop gives you both journey and destination.\r\n\r\nThe vocals on each track (incidentally, both songs are lifted from the band's upcoming album Picture) are simple and pretty in an almost affectless way that recalls Sufjan Stevens (as does the epic swarm of acoustic instruments), but where in Sufjan's music the endless repetition of harmony and rhythm (and even melody) gets tiring,Â <strong>\"Cuddle Magic\"</strong>Â is restless and shifting, and this keeps the music from ever becoming cloying or saccharine. There is in fact, despite the cutesy name, a pervasive, windy melancholy to their music that is crucial to its appeal. This is not disturbed (and is probably even enhanced) by the fact that the lyrics are almost entirely opaque.\r\n\r\nAs I said at the start, it would be easy to writeÂ <strong>Cuddle Magic</strong>Â off as reactionaries in an age of exciting new technology. Easy, that is, until you listen to their music and discover how beautiful and forward thinking and rich it all is. Movements in independent pop music come and go with alarming speed these days, but thankfully for all of us, people like Cuddle Magic are following their noses into some of the best and most unconventional pop songs we will ever have the privilege of downloading.",

		"content" : "There is a contradiction that hounds all music that resides somewhere near the crossroads of art and pop, said contradiction being more or less that art music is supposed to provoke and challenge the listener, while pop music is supposed to be catchy and digestible. Art music pokes you in the arm (kind of hard) and sits down to ask you troubling questions about man's place in the universe; pop music lies down at your feet and looks cute (if you think I'm being dismissive of pop music, ask yourself which of those things would be more welcome in your life at this very moment). A hybrid of these two styles is almost by definition impossible. A catchy melody gets stuck in your head and repeats itself endlessly, often on a first or second hearing. You find yourself humming it while making toast. This is the exact opposite of the awareness and attention and work that art music is supposed to require. You do not often find yourself mumbling excerpts from the Rite of Spring while pouring milk over your generic-brand Cheerios.\r\n\r\nSince good art music is by definition challenging, it requires of its creators a restlessness that would, generally speaking, devour a pop song whole, leaving only fragments behind. Think for example of the Akron/Family song â€œPart of Coreyâ€, which takes a delicate acoustic song and buries much of it in brutal static. When someone with this natural adventurous spirit decides to dedicate their life to pop music, we reap the always intriguing and sometimes baffling benefits. Why no, I haven't forgotten aboutÂ <strong>Trevor Wilson</strong>. This is just where Trevor Wilson comes in. First, an introduction: Wilson is a New England born pianist and songwriter possessed of an unusual fluttering voice, birdlike but substantial, which he controls with pleasing precision, ending most phrases with a burst of tightly packed vibrato. Vibrato has fallen out of style these days what with all the I'm-just-a-fragile-yet-soulful-guy-in-my-bedroom things going on, but man, sometimes it just sounds great. Wilson is relevant here not only because this article is about him but also because he has a predilection for very complex and conceptual pop music and because in the last few years he has produced a number of fantastic and completely different works, featuring incredibly detailed orchestrations, unorthodox forms, and melodies that draw recklessly from some of the newest and oldest traditions of pop music. In his vocal swoops and quicksand harmonies, you can even hear strains of jazz, back when jazz was pop.\r\n\r\n2007'sÂ <strong>Tall Ships</strong>, the name of a five-piece band that has since disbanded, features the contrapuntal male-female vocals that are one of the staples ofÂ <strong>Wilson's</strong>Â songs. Lacking the conceptual angle of the more recent stuff, Tall Ships features a number of songs about things, but the most striking elements here are the gentle and subtle complexities of rhythm and form. Three of the first four songs are in five-four time, something you probably wouldn't notice until you'd listened through a few times, and the vocal melodies leap and curve all over the place. Try singing along. It's hard. The songs also feature some seriously nontraditional harmony, which blows by you so fast under the busy melodies that again, it takes a long time to even notice. Instruments definitely suggest their own directions, harmonically speaking, and Wilson's being a pianist has certainly affected his songwriting in a delightful and refreshing way.\r\n\r\n<strong>Plants &amp; Bodies</strong>, released last year, is a collection of two themed song cycles. The first, full of plant metaphors that are sometimes more appropriate than others, features huge arrangements, packed to overflowing with accordion, strings, harp, percussion and scores of voices, while the second uses a more pared down piano and voice setup, bringingÂ <strong>Wilson's</strong>Â voice into the fore and providing a detox period after the madly bustling orchestrations of the first half. The songs swing and bounce and coast and glide and never ever stop moving, in a way that is both immensely satisfying and really difficult. It takes a few spins through before you start to get your bearings, but like most music that requires some work, it's incredibly rewarding. Hearing the drums quickly paraphrase the vocal line, or the sudden entrance and disappearance of a richly harmonious string quartet is the kind of thing that makes art music so nourishing. The more you listen, the more you begin to see all the carefully positioned elements, like easter eggs coded into a video game for diehard fans. The first time I ever met Wilson he spent thirty minutes compulsively aligning the CDs I had given him with the corner of the coffee table (while we were talking, he's not a weirdo), so I have no doubt that every note here is full of intention.\r\n\r\nThis year has seen the online-only release (viaÂ <a href=\"http://trevorwilson.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wilson's Bandcamp site</a>) of a triptych of conceptual song cycles.Â  The first, entitledÂ <strong>Growth &amp; Decay</strong>Â and concerned with the very same stuff, is written for string quartet, vocal quartet and lead vocalist.Â  The second is an album of ukulele driven compositions, entitledÂ <strong>Anawan</strong>.Â  And the third, from whichÂ <strong>â€œB-side \"Destinationâ€</strong>Â is drawn, is fromÂ <strong>Hard Times</strong>, an album concerned with the post-college lull and economic downturn.Â  Not to mention, of course, this here digital single, which features two new tracks. The first,Â <strong>â€œEl Regaloâ€</strong>, is a bit of an outlier in Wilsonâ€™s catalogue, by his own description, while the second,Â <strong>â€œDestinationâ€</strong>, comes from the Hard TimesÂ <em>ghost album</em>, as Wilson calls it.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"El Regalo\"</strong>, sung oddly enough in Spanish, features a dancy, reggaeton inspired beat (creatively spiced up with some disguised vocal sounds) and at least two of those incredibly catchy syllabic melodies thatÂ <strong>Wilson</strong>Â manages to insert into nearly every single song he writes. The middle section deviates away from the more traditional-sounding verse melody and into some increasingly trippy Os Mutantes style latin-psych, with guitar and piano taking increasingly frantic and atonal solos over a lazily descending vocal line.Â <strong>B-side \"Destination\"</strong>Â streams neatly rhyming post-college depression lyrics (pride and guilt start pouring in/can't move back into mom's basement) over a bouncy, two-triad, oom-pah piano figure that honestly sounds a bit like an Andrew Lloyd Weber song. The lyrics are alternately silly and dark, displaying a healthy skepticism of Wilson's newly acquired degree, and settling finally on humble acceptance and a lime-juicing scheme. The willingness displayed here to do things like sing in spanish, take an 80 second guitar solo in a song that's less than three minutes long, and play with genres as untouched by most indie poppers as reggaeton and showtunes is exactly the kind of thing that makes Wilson worth listening to and following, though this kind of openness inherently leads to some missteps.\r\n\r\n<strong>Wilson</strong>Â calls forthcoming albumÂ <strong>Anawan</strong>Â <em>â€œan investigation of the effects of constantly searching,â€</em>Â a phrase that could easily be taken and applied to his entire musical career thus far. Even within the boundaries of individual songs he is bursting with ideas, shifting forms, keys, melodies. You get the sense that the triumphant breakthrough is somewhere ahead of him, maybe not too far, and that when he hits it, the first thing he will do is start looking for the next one.",

		"content" : "Those of you familiar with Showtime's Weeds might already have rubbed aural elbows withÂ <strong>Spirit Kid</strong>Â (A.K.A.Â <strong>Emeen Zarookian</strong>, the man with the most fabulous name in the universe) via anÂ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfiaC-2K1LM\" target=\"_blank\">online only promo video</a>Â (see below) that lifts his madly catchy and jangly AmpeaterÂ <strong>A-side \"You Lit Up For Me\"Â </strong>and gleefully reinterprets the lyrics in a way that you need only stare at the song title for two seconds to guess at. In fact, the song is secretly an elegy to a lost and puddle-killed cell phone (think about it:Â <em>you fell down / out of my pocket and into the sea / you lit up for me</em>), and this contrast between the hidden, mundane inspiration and the perfectly open ended lyrics is a perfect distillation of Spirit Kid. \"You Lit Up For Me\" is a perfect, concise pop song, recorded with a warm, full and just slightly muddy sound that sounds both musically and tonally straight out of 1965 (Zarookian lists the Beatles, Kinks, Beach Boys, and Zombies as influences and let me tell you, you can hear it in the best way) and yet with a secretly contemporary source. Who among us doesn't know the anxiety of a lost cell phone? Who would think to write a song about it? Meet the Spirit Kid, a man who, in his own words, is trying to captureÂ <em>\"a child-like willingness to experience the world with open eyes and a open heart, something that many of us, including me, often let slip away with our own daily problems.\"</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Spirit Kid</strong>Â songs are short and crammed to bursting with ideas. They stand in direct opposition to anything even remotely shaggy, as sharply dressed as those aforementioned English pop heroes of the sixties. They would sound surgical if they weren't so damned fun, performed with a charming looseness that belies the years this album has been in the making. You can hear lord knows how manyÂ <strong>Emmens</strong>Â shoutingÂ <em>\"I miss you terribly\"</em>Â onÂ <strong>\"You Lit Up For Me\"</strong>Â in a big, bawling chorus of voices that you'd never hear on a more cleanly produced (read: sterile) album. It's the kind of shouty vocal harmony that's not supposed to be perfectly in harmony. There's a thickness to this kind of sound that autotune can never reach with its unnecessary clarity (nothing against autotune, which can clearly be used to do some cool shit but should never, ever be applied to the vocals in a guitars-bass-drums-catchysongs kind of rock band). Album cut \"Wait A Minute\" pretty much dissolves halfway through in a pile of full kit crashes and guitar solos before popping back into the bubbly country pop verses. The fact that Zarookian recorded this entire record himself (with mixing help from Jack Younger of 247 Studios) in bedrooms, bathrooms, basement rec rooms, graffiti-covered practice spaces, etc., etc., lends the whole thing a warmth and relaxed energy that just doesn't materialize in albums constructed in imposing studios.\r\n\r\nThoughÂ <strong>Zarookian's</strong>Â musical roots lie mostly in the tight (bounce-a-quarter-off-that-song tight) mod pop of decades hence, he has cousins in recent times as well. Dr. Dog, especially on their near-flawless Easybeat, drew from some of the same pools, bringing back the big vocal harmonies and fluid, traditional harmony that makes Lennon/Mccartney songs sound so endlessly inventive and yet perfectly logical. That style of harmony (which incidentally is a huge part of why all those girl group pop songs that came out of the Brill Building are so amazing, when you combine it with the whole Phil Spector production style) is mostly neglected these days in favor of a minimalist diatonic (read: boring, two chords, maybe three) kind of thing.\r\n\r\nAnother musical relative is Elliott Smith, who you can hear in the ascending bridge ofÂ <strong>B-side \"My Imagination\"</strong>, in the way the melody on another album track (\"The World Doesn't Stop\") resolves down a half step instead of the expected whole step, in the pure melody of the guitar solos, in the tight vocal harmonies and use of fancy little diminished passing chords, and who of course played all the instruments on his first few albums much in the wayÂ <strong>Zarookian</strong>Â does here. But don't let that make you think the attitude here is anything but joyous or the playing anything but accomplished. The drumming is propulsive and never shaky, pushing the piano riff of \"My Imagination\" forward with enough force to make it sound like a lost Big Star cut. The bass playing deserves 1000 words on its own, generating enough melodies to make about three more records. Check out the way it navigates the modulating half-time section of the bridge of \"My Imagination\", just spitting out ideas left and right. The piano hits hard and nails the obligatory giant glissandos at the climaxes. The vocals, as mentioned, perfectly pin down all the harmonies, for example the echoing I get scareds or ooh la la las in the second verse of \"My Imagination\".\r\n\r\n<strong>\"You Lit Up For Me\"</strong>, the aforementioned A-side, is a perfectly crafted pop gem, with crescendoing mobs of voices over the kind of loping country feel that shows up on a few of the other album tracks, here trading off with more reserved, open interludes. The way the vocals build and build up into an avalanche that tumbles right into the rolling, jouncing percussion of the verses is the most immediate evidence ofÂ <strong>Spirit Kid's</strong>Â genius for that long stretched and bruised art form: the song. The multiple layers of vocals that emerge after each extended verse chord are perfect, pure momentum, leaping in each time you think the chord just has to change. It's the kind of song you want to listen to whilst cutting down the street on a sunny Sunday afternoon with not much on your mind, maybe on your way out to get some brunch, preferably on repeat.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"My Imagination\"</strong>Â is more complex, with more sections and more of those fantastic bass lines climbing all over the place like kids on a jungle gym. The song itself is great, catchy, full of motion, but even more than that there are the endless tiny touches of idiosyncrasy, the kind of thing that makes albums like, say, Pet Sounds so amazing and permanently listenable. The way the bass doesn't seriously enter until that ballsy fill around 11 seconds; the aforementioned ooh la la las, the way that every drum break on that minor chord comes back not on the one but a half beat early, the constant shifting of drum feels, the modulations and modulations of the bridge rising all the way into the triumphant falsetto, the drum fill at 2:15, the call and response of the harmony vocals just after that (<em>\"not tough\"</em>), the phaseredÂ <em>\"my my my imagination\"</em>Â over the ending. There is so much in these songs. I could keep going, too, though for practical reasons (read: boredom) I will spare you.\r\n\r\nThe great thing, for you, for me, for theÂ <strong>Spirit Kid</strong>, is that these songs are A) so intoxicatingly enjoyable that it takes no effort whatsoever to just nod your head and think yes and B) so well arranged and interestingly built that you can sit here and write, oh, I dunno, 1259 words on them and there will still be more and more and more to say. It's a shame it looks like the album's going to be coming out in the winter, because it really deserves to be the soundtrack to your next summer. Those of you in New Zealand take note.",

		"content" : "I love the internet.Â  It's great to live in an age where two ordinary friends in a small town in Upstate New York can self produce an extraordinary EP and rise to indie fame in a matter of months.Â  Or perhaps multi-instrumentalistÂ <strong>Chris Clarke</strong>Â and vocalistÂ <strong>Meadow Eliz</strong>Â were not so ordinary to begin with.Â  Nevertheless, the pair have done pretty well for themselves considering that they met little more than a year ago.Â  Here's a short chronology of their efforts: October 2008:Â <strong>Eliz</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Clarke</strong>Â meet at bowling alley in Saranac Lake, Population 5041.Â  Shortly afterwards, they cross paths at the deli in which Eliz is working.Â  From these humble beginnings a strong friendship is formed.\r\n\r\nFall 2008:Â <strong>Eliz</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Clarke</strong>Â work together composing music for a student theatre production at St. Lawrence University.Â  They enjoy collaborating so much that they decide to continue making music after the production ends.\r\n\r\nWinter 2009:Â <strong>Eliz</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Clarke</strong>Â find relief from the snowy subzero climate of Saranac Lake in Clarkeâ€™s home studio.Â  Armed with a Casio keyboard, a laptop, a hodge-podge of analog equipment, and a bit of instrumentation help from some friends, they record and produce an EP under the nameÂ <strong>Swimming in Speakers</strong>.\r\n\r\nFrom there, it all happened virtually overnight.Â Â <strong>Eliz</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Clarke</strong>Â quickly becomeÂ <em>\"darlings of the internet.\"</em>Â Theyâ€™ve been interviewed on a number of blogs and radio stations and their songÂ <strong>\"In Knowing\"</strong>Â was aired on BBC 6 Music with an introduction by Tom Robinson.\r\n\r\nEverybody loves a happy ending, but happy beginnings are nice too andÂ <strong>Swimming in Speakers</strong>Â has had an unusually happy beginning.Â  Sure theyâ€™ve gotten a few lucky breaks, but thatâ€™s not to say that their success is undeserved.Â  On the contrary, I think they have potential to be huge.Â  And with any luck, this feature in The Ampeater Review will catapult them into the upper echelons of stardom (or more likely, their success will help this modest website get a few more views).Â  That said, Iâ€™m going to stop pontificating for a moment and give the music a chance to speak for itself.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side \"In Knowing\"</strong>Â is the first cut and obvious radio single offÂ <strong>Swimming In Speakers EP</strong>. It has a strong grove and enough hooks to catch any listener.Â  The recording is masterfully produced, with bubbling synths bouncing around in stereo and layers of vocals overdubbed in all the right places.Â  Normally Iâ€™m a bit wary of any band that uses a Casio keyboard en lieu of a drummer, but in this case itâ€™s the perfect fit.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the catchy synth-pop instrumentals are what grabbed me on the first listen, itsÂ <strong>Elizâ€™s</strong>Â soft voice and off-kilter lyrics that have made a lasting impression and differentiateÂ <strong>\"In Knowing\"</strong>Â from other infectious jams.Â  The verses are meandering and verbose and donâ€™t follow a clear rhyme scheme.Â  One of my favorite lines:\r\n\r\n<em>\"I complete this representation of a utopian love affair within which you perform.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThe chorus, in contrast, is a simple refrain.Â  Itâ€™s easy to remember, but packed with ambiguity.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œIn knowing how do you decideâ€¦â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Elizâ€™s</strong>Â delivery is completely relaxed.Â  Although her voice is produced, it retains a distinctly natural quality.Â  And yet, it never seems at odds with the glossy instrumentals.Â  The two interact playfully, like the best of friend.\r\n\r\nLikeÂ <strong>Eliz</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Clarke</strong>.Â  Perhaps thatâ€™s a good way to think aboutÂ <strong>Swimming in Speakers</strong>â€¦Â  Itâ€™s the kind of music that only friends could make.Â  Eliz and Clarke have remarkable chemistry.Â  Â In an interview for American Indie, Clarke explained their songwriting process.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Usually, I will write a phrase or riff or beat or all three - Meadow will listen to all the ideas I have come up with over a couple of days - if something sparks her interest, we'll lay down some vocals. If we like what we have, Meadow will hunt for some lyrics, and we'll refine the melody.\"</em>\r\n\r\nOr, for a better glimpse into their creative process, check out this lyric sheet.Â Â <strong>Clarke</strong>Â typed the lyrics, andÂ <strong>Eliz</strong>Â is responsible for the corrections, doodles and all.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4077\" alt=\"Swimming In Speakers - Lyric Sheet\" src=\"http://www.ampeatermusic.com/media/aem025/swimming-in-speakers-lyric-sheet.jpg\" width=\"541\" height=\"604\" />\r\n\r\nBothÂ <strong>Eliz</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Clarke</strong>Â are self taught musicians. In fact, Eliz explains that as a child she was prohibited from taking voice lessons because her momÂ <em>\"didn't want someone tinkering with my instrument.\"Â </em>An unusual decision, but definitely the right one.Â  Uncorrupted by theory, the pair embrace their natural understanding of music.\r\n\r\nAlthoughÂ <strong>Swimming in Speakers</strong>Â began as a studio project, fueled by their success,Â <strong>Clarke</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Eliz</strong>Â have recruited a number of friends to help flush out their live set. The current lineup includesÂ <strong>Kyle Murray</strong>Â on drums and percussion,Â <strong>Christina Grant</strong>Â on cello, andÂ <strong>Colin Dehond</strong>Â on additional instrumentation. Live, they have an incredibly organic feel and employ an amazing array of strings and percussion, as well as instrumentation you couldn't imagine (e.g. didgeridoo, mouth harp, etc).Â  Since the transformation ofÂ <strong>Swimming in Speakers</strong>Â from a studio project into a performing band, the group has moved in a slightly new direction, putting more focus on acoustic instruments.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"Nevergreen\"</strong>Â is a stripped down acoustic ditty.Â  The arrangement is remarkably sparse; the only instruments are a tinny lightly-picked acoustic guitar, and a sweet cello.Â  On the second verse, reversed sounds bounce around in stereo, but only peripherally, as an extra color rather than a focal point.Â  The nuances ofÂ <strong>Elizâ€™s</strong>Â voice are more readily apparent when not competing for attention with heavy synths.Â  While the lyrics of \"Nevergreen\" are relatively simple, but she does a lot with her phrasing and articulation.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Oh wait, once more, will you come back to meâ€¦\"</em>\r\n\r\nShe plays with thatÂ <em>\"me\"</em>Â for three times the length of the phrase, bending in and out of a soft falsetto.\r\n\r\nAsÂ <strong>Swimming in Speakers</strong>Â rounds their one year anniversary, it will be interesting to see how they evolve.Â  How will the calm sounds of Saranac Lake mesh with the bustle of NYC?Â  Eagerly awaiting a full length album.",

		"content" : "<strong>Nick Koenig</strong>, for one of his new songs, made a field recording of the wind, mapped the sound to a keyboard, and played out a melody on the breeze. OK Pocahontas. But seriously, this found-sound techniqueâ€”which extends throughout Koenig akaÂ <strong>Hot Sugarâ€™s</strong>Â oeuvreâ€”deserves some attention. Not in the sense that these kinds of excavations are new: over half-a-centuryâ€™s worth of art music experimentalists and Japanoise terrorists have found ample sonic uses for everything from vacuum cleaners to plastic surgery procedures. What makes Hot Sugar interesting, however, is not the aesthetic extremism or aggressive anti-musicality of someone like, say, Merzbow, but rather the prettiness, catchiness, even humanism this artist extracts from these instrumental (but not instrument) materials. In the world of outre industrio-acoustic studies, this kind of pop-smithing amounts, ironically, to the opposite of conventionality, a length of particularly percussive copper piping swung at the hydrahead of No Fun conservatism. In Hot Sugarâ€™s mellotron, tunefulness becomes radical.\r\n\r\nI draw this parallel betweenÂ <strong>Koenig</strong>Â and some of the more esoteric examples of tape-n-scrape not because the two sound anything alike, but because the connection shows that the term â€œ<em>noise musicâ€</em>Â is, and perhaps always was, kind of meaningless.Â <strong>Hot Sugarâ€™s</strong>Â style, despite resembling some kind of crossbreed of 70s blaxploitation soundtracks, ambient house, and 8-bit video game themes, is nonetheless akin, at least in practice, to EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten tape-looping a crate of plates breaking in a dank German warehouse. But where Industrial purists misused machinery to create literal, albeit borderline unlistenable, portraits of urban decay, Hot Sugar solders the same base metals into something you could find on the radio, although maybe 500 years in the future, and in space.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œGus Sneaks Out,â€</strong>Â might be what happens when you put a trunk-mounted subwoofer in a wind-up music box. HowÂ <strong>Koenig</strong>Â makes this stuff happen is still mostly a mystery to me, but while the tune is busy with whirrs and blips and cut-up stabs, it still thumps like a motherfucker--a form of lowrider music for the tiny, imaginary people who live under my floorboards. When we spoke, the man behindÂ <strong>Hot Sugar</strong>Â mentioned that he was using vocalists and MCs for his upcoming full-length, and while itâ€™s not hard to imagine someone spitting bars over this instrumental, it is hard to place, exactly, how such an addition would change the vibe. This music, despite the heavy-processing of its origins, still manages to come across as deeply, cellularly organicâ€”even wooly. Iâ€™ve tried rapping on the track a couple of times, and although Iâ€™ve attempted using real words, the only thing that seems to sound even remotely correct is a kind of syncopated gorilla bark. This, I guess, is the real Jungle music.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œJuicing Upâ€</strong>Â is a slightly different story. A titular reference to consuming a juice box, and not, I believe, abusing steroids, the B-side contains one of the insatiably hooky lead-lines sinceÂ â€œThe Final Countdown,â€Â the kind of melody that replicates itself virally inside your brain and causes breakouts at embarrassing times. This is mission music, the kind of thing you would listen to en route to the most important thing ever, and then listen to again on your way home. Fuck Ritalin. â€œJuicing Upâ€ is like musical concentration from concentrate, archetypically empowering in the sense that it might actually make you think youâ€™re the ubermensch, or at least his Game Boy screen doppelganger. Never let me drive to this song, because Iâ€™d focus on the road so hard Iâ€™d come to a complete standstill in moving traffic. No vocals here. No distractions either.\r\n\r\nThe point to these extended forays into personal anecdote is thatÂ <strong>Koenigâ€™s</strong>Â music is, for samples culled fromÂ <em>â€œthings you canâ€™t buy commerciallyâ€Â </em>(as the artist says),Â well, personal. If quintessential noise music is alienating, thenÂ <strong>Hot Sugarâ€™s</strong>Â noises are quintessentially emotional, the end result of an alchemical process by which all frequencies and found sounds can be rendered coextensive with the human soul.",

		"content" : "I first metÂ <strong>Zeke Virant</strong>Â when I was living in the East Village after my first year of college. Virant was living nearby with a model who liked to cook biscuits and gravy. He would frequently pop over to my tiny sixth-floor walk up. Weâ€™d cram into the little bedroom I shared with a friend and play god knows what with a bass and 3 drums. Those were the days. Virant's musical gifts were immediately apparent. He had an amazing ear for slinking bass lines and liked to play around with extended techniques (including, but not limited to playing the bass with a spoon). We only had a summer of musical interaction, but that was long enough for me to realize that I had encountered someone truly special.\r\n\r\n<strong>Virant</strong>Â went on to study poetry and music at Bard college, a hotbed of young artistic activity along the Hudson. Under the tutelage of the formidable critic and composer Kyle Gann, among others, he developed some serious compositional chops, going on to write an absolutely killerÂ <a href=\"http://www.zekevirant.com/ocean.html\" target=\"_blank\">opera</a>Â (as he put it,Â <em>â€œa chamber ensemble with chorus in a story-telling psychological thing operaâ€</em>Â ) including the personae Peppermint Man, Shades McGlenn, and Shadesâ€™s bandâ€”The Wobbler (drums), The Doctor (guitar) and Taps Fahrenheit (bass). He also developed a killer work ethic. A friend once told me that Virant refused to party on a Friday night because he was reading about Mahler.Â <em>â€œWhy are you reading about Mahler,â€</em>Â my friend asked,Â <em>â€œif you hate him so much?â€ â€œBecause I hate him!â€Â </em>responded Mr. Virant.\r\n\r\nThe picture Iâ€™ve painted here might not match the accompanying musical material. In a way, however, the stylistic diversity (and sense of humor) on display here are an even further testament toÂ <strong>Virantâ€™s</strong>Â abilities. Take<strong>Â A-side â€œBaby, Donâ€™t Cry,â€</strong>Â a wonderful 50s-inflected ditty. Barely hanging together, admirably casual, itâ€™s not unlike the booze-soaked tapes of Beckâ€™s Mellow Gold<em>Â </em>or the psilocybin pastiche of Ween. Plus, you gotta love any song with enough vocal fuzz to make pipes sound like a synthesizer.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œHow Much Corn Can You Put Up Your Nose?â€</strong>Â follows genre-hopping suit, this time venturing into the realm of kinky techno. The title is ridiculous, the lyrics are ridiculous (I bet you can guess them without even hearing the song), but the song avoids total silliness by virtue of its awesomeness. All in all, itâ€™s a pretty inventive arrangement with crazy-sounding and hilarious acid synths. Outstanding!\r\n\r\nTalking toÂ <strong>Virant</strong>, Iâ€™m reminded of the avant-garde/pop, serious/kitsch dichotomies of Frank Zappa, a man who wrote songs about fellatio in Spanish and compositions conducted by Pierre Boulez in the same career.Â <em>â€œI like to do a lot of different music, not styles (ain't got none), but performance situations. Sometimes the garage-band rock band thing (<a href=\"http://www.zekevirant.com/goons.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Triangle Goons</a>), sometimes, sometimes I will dress up as an old burnout performer namedÂ <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/shadesmcglenn\" target=\"_blank\">Shades McGlenn</a>Â and tell stories and sing songs. I was born in Georgia in the middle of nowhere, but I've been away from that long enough that it's hard to claim I'm a \"Southerner\" in a musical sense. I mean, I like the Allman Brothers Band, but I sort of fucked that up by going to school, so of course, now I listen John Cage and Mozart a whole lot, too. I do a lot of writing because it's supposed to be a whole lot of things working towards one goal. Prince and Jimmy Page are Prince and Led Zeppelin not because they just played guitar or wrote songs. Those motherfuckers put on makeup and dragon suits, spent years developing a personal style of recording their music and making a sound, AND they wrote and played the music to incorporate it all. So, what I'm trying to do is to try to figure out a way of incorporating poetry people would otherwise not read, with music people would not listen to, with a body that no one would desire, and work with it!â€</em>",

		"content" : "When I was sixteen and at the height of myÂ <strong>Microphones</strong>Â obsession, I sawÂ <strong>Phil Elverum</strong>Â at the First Unitarian Church in Philadelphia.Â <em>[Ed.: Jake, why do all of your reviews start with an adolescent anecdote? Are you writing about music just to revisit your unspoiled youth? Jake: Umâ€¦Yes.]</em>Â The set had all the familiar Microphones vibes: pseudo-mystical lyrical meanderings, fans sitting on stage, and endearingly mousy stage banter. The real surprise came when I asked Elverum to sign my journal. Rather than give me the minimum-effort John Hancock, he spent ten minutes drawing an enormous mountain towering over the clouds.Â <em>\"That's Mount Eerie,\"</em>Â he said, pointing to the mountain,Â <em>â€œand that's the world.\"Â </em>No one, including Elverum, has unlocked the full significance of Mount Eerie the concept, but that hasn't stopped him from delving deep into murky symbolism. Since that concert, the Microphones have ditched their original moniker for Mount Eerie, released Mount Eerie Pts. 6 and 7 as a sequel to the five-track Microphones swan song calledâ€”you guessed itâ€”Mount Eerie. More recently, Elverum has been exploring the sounds of Norwegian Black Metal, an element once present in classic Microphones songs like â€œSamurai Sword,â€ now brought to the fore in albums likeÂ <strong>Black Wooden Ceiling OpeningÂ </strong>(2008) and, most recently,Â <strong>Windâ€™s PoemÂ </strong>(2009). Elverum's story is a familiar one. Music loving kid works in a record shop, starts playing around with recording equipment, records sloppy and earnest demos. The difference between Phil Elverum and other home recording artists, however, is that his recording projects eventually caught the attention of Calvin Johnson, founding member of Beat Happening and head of K records, during a brief stint in Olympia. Elverum was given access to Johnsonâ€™s famous Dub Narcotic studio where he began a long discography as The Microphones, includingÂ <strong>It Was Hot, We Stayed in the WaterÂ </strong>(2000) and the seminalÂ <strong>The Glow, pt. 2Â </strong>(2001), the latter of which was recently treated to deluxe reissue. While The Glow, pt. 2 was and remains his most critically acclaimed album, 2004â€™s Mount Eerie unveiled the severest themes of Elverum's imagination. Confronting death, rebirth, nature, and the universe, the album was an epic five-part opera set on Mount Eerieâ€”a real mountain on Fidalgo island that looms over Elverumâ€™s homebase in Anacortes, WA. It may have been unintelligible to those whoâ€™d been won by The Microphonesâ€™ more concise lo-fi folk statements; for others it represented the culmination of a geniusâ€™ lifelong meditation on the universeâ€™s mysteries.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke toÂ <strong>Elverum</strong>Â he was reluctant to embrace an overarching thematic interpretation of his music.Â <em>â€œI guess itâ€™s true that my songs can seem focused on nature, but itâ€™s not intentional,â€Â </em>he said.Â <em>â€œItâ€™s just the world that makes sense to me. Maybe it had to do with growing up with my family and going on camping tripsâ€¦ But Iâ€™m really hesitant to talk about nature as this picturesque, separate place other than the world we live in. When I sing about nature, I feel like Iâ€™m trying to sing about the same world that we all live in and that there are these totally wild things that are totally natural that happen in our daily lives. Itâ€™s not like you live your life, and then you go on vacation to a beautiful place, and then come back to real life.â€</em>\r\n\r\nAfter the heady explorations ofÂ <strong>Mount Eerie</strong>Â the album,Â <strong>The Microphones</strong>Â were reincarnated asÂ <strong>Mount EerieÂ </strong>the band. Itâ€™s unclear what exactly prompted the name change. Of course, that element of mystery is a vital part ofÂ <strong>Elverum's</strong>Â aesthetic language.Â <em>â€œAll of my stuff that I do I end up having not that much control over it. It just comes out, you know? So I can only look at it from the same perspective as you, like â€˜oh well from this era there are a bunch of songs about this topic and from another era there are a bunch of songs about that.â€™â€</em>Â This might seem like a frustratingly lazy attempt at self-definition, but thereâ€™s something much deeper at play.Â <em>â€œI kind of consider all of my songs to be part of one big project,â€</em>Â he explains.Â <em>â€œAlthough some songs are little islands of their own, they donâ€™t get touched once theyâ€™re done, most of them are just part of this larger conversation that Iâ€™m having with myself.â€</em>Â Rather than try to plot a grand aesthetic mission and force all his music into that mold, Elverum writes songs about life the way we actually live our livesâ€”with great uncertainty and open senses.\r\n\r\nThat openness has recently pervaded the recording process.Â <strong>A-side â€œLost Wisdom,â€Â </strong>the eponymous track fromÂ <strong>Mount Eerieâ€™s</strong>Â 2008 LP, was a spontaneous home-recording session with Julie and Fred Doiron of the influential Canadian outfit Ericâ€™s Trip.Â <em>â€œWell, we didnâ€™t intend to record an album,â€</em>Â <strong>Elverum</strong>Â explained.Â <em>â€œWe were just casually recording these songs in my studio, for no reason. It was ambiguous what they were going to be used for.â€</em>Â Despite Elverum's modest deferral to the forces of spontaneity and ambiguity, this song proves to be a mini-masterwork. Just dig the lyrics, which are so personal as to render personhood an uncanny specter:Â <em>â€œMy lost face in the mirror in the gas station/ Who are you but my face that I wake up with alone?â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œStoneâ€™s Odeâ€</strong>Â charts an epiphany at the foot of natural wonders. Suddenly,Â <em>â€œlife has new meaning. Alive, propped on bones, overwhelming feeling.â€</em>Â Sentiments like these abound inÂ <strong>Elverumâ€™s</strong>Â music, which seeks beauty in the self as much as it does in the wonder of our environment (broadly construed). Itâ€™s the mysterious alchemy of the personal and the universal that givesÂ <strong>Mount Eerie</strong>Â its unfamiliar familiarity. Sometimes, magic. The great expanse of our senses induces a moment of spiritual clarity. The vessel of spirit, the self, becomes untenable, vaporous.",

		"content" : "<strong>In Ampeater's words:</strong>\r\nIf there were such thing as a lifetime achievement award in independent rock,Â <strong>Pete Galub</strong>Â would deserve it more than anyone. For the past decade, he's been a perennial figure in the great melting pot of New York music's semi-underground, relevant and likable no matter where the trends have blown. Galub's music draws upon classic powerpop and punk conventions, but with refreshing edge and insight. His latest album Candy Tears represents another well placed step in this trajectory. Some seven years in the making, it's the work of a mature artist challenging himself to breathe new life into well-charted genres and, against all odds, succceeding gloriously. The hooks are instant but it's Galub's sharp intellect and attention to detail that hold it together.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"300 Days in July\"</strong>Â is one of the slowest tracks on the album, and also one of the most intriguing. It lumbers along at a lethargic 6/8 ballad pulse that never feels completely settled. The atmosphere is so surreal that any semblance of calm is eerie rather than comfortable. (It's no coincidence that the word 'drugs' stands out in the opening lyric.) Throughout the track, Galub expresses a deep sense of nostalgia but, as tends to be the case in his music, the sentiment is anything but straightforward. The song thrives on the tension between heart and mind. The urge to cling to the pastâ€”to slow the progress of timeâ€”is emotionally convincing, but cerebrally, the artist himself seems aware that to indulge in it would be destructive and ultimately futile. If Galub manages to draw the month of July out for 300 days, it's only by putting reality on hold for a while. When the song ends, it feels like waking up after taking twice the prescribed dose of sleeping pills. It's highly disorienting, to say the least. The summer seems at once more distant and more precious than ever.\r\n\r\nIn short, 300 Days in July is not really about nostalgia, but rather, its relevance to the present. Galub reminds us to appreciate the past, but not to let it consume us. And let's face it, it would only be too easy for an aging rocker in a scene dominated by teenage spirit to do so. Yet while music has always worshiped youth, Galub shows us the value of something full grown. His vision of rock hasn't gone gray, fattened up, sold out, or settled down, but it has grown more perceptive with time and experience. Galub hasn't lost himself in delusions of bygone summers, but he's certainly able to look back at them with greater clarity and recall a poignancy unnoticed in the moment.\r\n\r\n<strong>In the artist's words:</strong>\r\nI try not to give a shit about expectations when Iâ€™m playing music. Expectations donâ€™t have ears, and they often take away the urgency that is needed to play satisfying music. Music, at its best, is a living thing, always in flux, always becoming. Uncertainty can be an asset. I like the idea of creating something while staring death in the face. My favorite musicians, like my favorite people, are searchers. They know that sometimes the best songs are the ones that can play you. The ones that you can search around in, and find something different in, each time you play them. Those are the songs I try to write.",

		"content" : "Before this decade, only Canadian artists who had explosive popular appeal - like Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Alanis Morissette, Celine Dion and the rest - would make it in the States, their success having less to do with a homegrown Canadian music market and more to do with the open-armed American music industryâ€™s willingness to swallow any delicious pop morsel whole. Most other bands were left to wither in the lonely, obscure Canadian cold. And then Canada surprised everyone and produced, in one decade, not one but two genuine, sprawling homegrown scenes â€“ based in Toronto and Montreal, really the only two cities in Canada anyway - that led to great art-tinged pop groups whoÂ <em>also</em>Â found immense popularity across the border. Led by the New Pornographers and then Broken Social Scene and Arcade Fire, these groups have perhaps defined the sound of Indie rock in the last decade more than any others, American or Canadian. The explanation for their popularity has little to do with the Canadian scene itself: the burgeoning international indie movement of the last decade has created a larger venue for more experimental artists, and the online democratization of music has made it easier for new bands to catch a break regardless of their location.\r\n\r\nThere is nevertheless something distinctive about Canadian indie rock. While most American indie rock bands seem to revel in their go-it-alone attitude (only recently with projects like Dark Was the Night has any semblance of an American indie collective began to emerge) Canadian musicians often act collectivity.Â <strong>PS I Love You</strong>Â in some ways epitomizes this and in others throws it by the wayside. They are part of an online community that quadruples as the place to find the goings-on-about-town in their home of Kingston, Ontario, a record label, music video club and zine. And their first pressed single,Â <strong>â€œFaceloveâ€</strong>, came as the B-side on a (physical) 7-inch with their friends Diamond Rings (though the first track got someÂ <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11470-all-yr-songs/\" target=\"_blank\">Pitchfork love</a>, the B-side was largely overlooked).\r\n\r\nButÂ <strong>PS I Love You</strong>Â is just multi-instrumentalistÂ <strong>Paul Saulnier</strong>Â and drummerÂ <strong>Benjamin Nelson</strong>Â â€“ who lays down an excellent, feverish set throughout, especially featured onÂ <strong>A-side â€œFaceloveâ€</strong>Â â€“ and is primarily the lifelong musical journey of Saulnier. And yet they might as well be an army. Where the Japandroids, another recent breakout duo from Canada, describe themselves asÂ <em>\"a two piece trying to sound like a five piece band,\"</em>Â PS I Love You is a two-piece thatÂ <em>actually sounds like</em>Â a five piece band, with Saulnier on guitar, vocals and (via his seemingly possessed right foot) bass organ. Â Not that that really matters. I listened to this song for weeks without knowing that there were just two guys in the band. But it only adds to their mystique: when I offered them a gig (admittedly for basically nothing) they responded that, asÂ <em>â€œpoor Canadians,â€</em>Â they didnâ€™t even have passports (see theirÂ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YQxDNI3-8\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>Â too). For shame. These guys pack more than enough edge and just enough hook to fill whole hipster stadiums â€“ ones that donâ€™t usually serve as most-of-the-time ice rinks.\r\n\r\nIâ€™m serious. Why? Turn onÂ <strong>\"Facelove\"</strong>Â and keep reading. This single is pure propulsion. There is no hook or verse, just continual upward motion. Using the wavering, weighty bass organ as a jumping off point as it gains momentum, they briefly toy with a surrealistic love call (<em>â€œyour love is like a giant strawberry (or) a delicious glass of wine (or) a naive dream of mine / thrown in my face.â€</em>) but then cascade into a guitar solo that would put Jimmy Page to shame. Yes, there is something distinctly heavy metal about this song: the beat may be post-punk but the guitar solo is more Black Sabbath than Joy Division. The way he doubles the lines, his effortless shredding â€“Â <strong>Saulnier</strong>Â clearly has some nostalgia for times when guitarists proved themselves by doing more than looking pissed off. And just when you might expect them to pull a 360, to return to Saulnierâ€™s high-pitched hoarse cry, they just keep pushing, turning the bridge into a never-ending solo that makes you wonder if the guitar is going to fly right out of his hands. No need for another verse; that would bring these guys back to earth. They are in outer-fu*king space.\r\n\r\nWhereÂ <strong>A-side \"Facelove\"</strong>Â sounds like bits grabbed from the last forty years of rock thrown into a smelter and served hot,Â <strong>B-side \"Subtle and Majestic\"</strong>Â firmly situatesÂ <strong>PS I Love You</strong>Â in the Canadian indie rock scene. Recalling the more spacious singles of Broken Social Sceneâ€™s You Forgot It In People, the lightly picked guitars and delicate chords complementÂ <strong>Saulnierâ€™s</strong>Â off-pitched voice and render it as something that is both serene and grubby. He conveys the mix of sincerity and self-deprecation that every musically-inclined dude has experienced when making a mixtape for a significant other (hopeful or real):Â <em>â€œI'm not trying to be romantic but I made you this mixtape/ It's subtle and majestic and I know that you've probably heard most of these songs before/ But this time they're from me/So you can really hear what they actually mean.â€</em>Â He gets at that perhaps ridiculous (or, in the opinion of this mixtape obsessed writer, perhaps not) feeling that, by putting songs in their just-perfect order, you put your unique mark on them and make them real for your obviously floored listener. More, Saulnierâ€™s strained but powerful call at the end of \"Subtle and Majestic\" (<em>â€œLetâ€™s quit smoking together/letâ€™s start smoking togetherâ€</em>) expresses the familiar longing to undertake shared projects with another, though which particular project is basically irrelevant. What matters is that last part: together.\r\n\r\nI think we like bands best that take the familiar and put an unusual twist on it; that donâ€™t so much re-invent a genre as perfect it. With hard hitting beats, sweet guitar hooks, someÂ <em>seriously</em>Â heavy bass organ and just a bit of self-conscious sensitivity,Â <strong>PS I Love You</strong>Â is able to be both a part and an extension of their scene and sound. Now letâ€™s get them some passports.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

		"content" : "So I'm readingÂ <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Guided-Voices-History-Twenty-One-Accidents/dp/0802170137/\" target=\"_blank\">this Guided By Voices tell-all biography</a>Â in an attempt to catch up on the last 20 years of their music. Being a child of the 2000s with respect to my artistic tastes, I seemed to have missed out on the lo-fi indie movement altogether, until people old enough to be my father kept mentioning bands like Guided By Voices and Pavement with a kind of religious reverence. And I have to say, my first impressions of the whole scene weren't too great. I wasn't immediately \"struck\" by the enormity of their talents. But here I am, reading a Guided By Voices biography in an attempt to \"get\" it, and I'm just starting to gain some perspective. In order to fully appreciate some music, it's necessary to suspend one's critical faculties and just dive straight in, to accept that the mind behind it is infallibly brilliant, and that any misgivings on one's own part are nothing but critical paranoia. Once this happens, something clicks, andÂ <em>just like thatÂ </em>a once scorned album turns into a perennial favorite. To paraphrase Scat records founder Robert Griffin on Guided By Voices' notoriously abrasive Vampire on Titus, \"Once you get inside, it's a pretty big house in there.\" This is the mindset with which to approach theÂ <strong>Unsacred Hearts</strong>, so take my hand and let's step inside the house.\r\n\r\nThe originalÂ <strong>Unsacred Hearts</strong>Â formula was a simple one: bang it out fast and loud, rely heavily on frequent references (both lyrical and musical) to the rock 'n roll music that they worshipped, and drink as much beer as possible all the time. In striving to be equal parts Bruce Springsteen, Robert Pollard, and Lou Reed, the Unsacred Hearts succeeded in creating something that's entirely their own, and a handful of listeners responded with appropriate enthusiasm. One critic once wrote<em>, \"They're less of a band than they are UPS delivery-men, each song a neat little 3 minute package of tight catchy riffs and shout/sung lyrics, each song like getting a hallmark card from your Nana but instead of there being a ten dollar bill inside it just says 'Fuck you.'\"</em>Â Another affirmed,Â <em>\"The Unsacred Hearts take their music wherever they damn well feel like, and they do it with a certainty and swagger that is becoming rare.\"</em>Â Over the years, the band's evolved as the lineup's changed (<strong>Andy Bean</strong>Â of theÂ <strong><a href=\"http://www.thetwogentlemen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Two Man Gentlemen Band</a></strong>Â replaced original bassistÂ <strong>Andy Ross</strong>Â when he left in 2005 to joinÂ <strong><a href=\"http://www.okgo.net/\" target=\"_blank\">OK Go</a></strong>) and its members have mellowed out a bit with age. The urgency of their early records has dissipated somewhat, and the interest on their ten dollarÂ <em>\"fuck you\"</em>Â has accrued to a hundred dollarÂ <em>\"I don't really give a fuck.\"</em>Â And they don't. Well, they do, but they don't. These are musicians who care deeply about their music and how it's presented, but if they happen to come across as a bit too abrasive on first listen, they're not about to write a postcard asking for a second chance. It'sÂ <em>your</em>Â loss, not theirs.\r\n\r\nAmpeater is proud to premiere two newÂ <strong>Unsacred Hearts</strong>Â songs on this 7-inch:Â <strong>A-side \"Fake Kisses\"Â </strong>andÂ <strong>B-side \"Sleepwalker\"</strong>. The band generally divides their catalog into \"rock\" tunes (which are more post-punk than anything else) and \"jazzy\" tunes (meaning, anything other than \"rock\" tunes). Over time, the balance of \"rock\" tunes to \"jazzy\" tunes shifted from something like 90/10 to 30/70, and the band now regularly indulges in moments (and even whole songs) during which the testosterone oozing from their amplifiers has a chance to regroup and listen to something pretty. Even \"Fake Kisses,\" which is more or less perfectly representative of the Unsacred Hearts' \"rock\" side, has an air of maturity about it that didn't exist at all on their 2004Â <strong>Unsacred Hearts</strong>Â EP and was only hinted at on 2006'sÂ <strong>In Defense of Fort Useless</strong>. The tune opens with a groove-setting intro riff on theÂ <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komuz\" target=\"_blank\">komuz</a>, of all instruments. Guitar-masterÂ <strong>Dave Siegel</strong>Â brought this Kyrgyzstani influence into the mix (a little George Harrison, anyone?) and it's a welcome addition to his brilliantly spastic guitar solo (a little Keith Richards, anyone?). Part of what makes the Unsacred Hearts more worthy of serious consideration than your average bar band is the sheer virtuosity of all its members. DrummerÂ <strong>Travis HarrisonÂ </strong>is an absolute beast on the skins (tune in to the drum feature that starts around 2:30), and gentlemanÂ <strong>Andy Bean</strong>Â lays down a rock solid bass. And then there's vocalist and lyricistÂ <strong>Joe Willie</strong>. He doesn't so much sing as he does yell, and I'm never sure whether he's yellingÂ <em>atÂ </em>me orÂ <em>with</em>Â me, but I suppose it's at times one, at times the other, and most of the time a bit of both. A little passive-aggressive attitude goes a long way, and it's an essential part of what makes the Unsacred Hearts a truly great band.\r\n\r\n<strong>Side B</strong>Â <strong>\"Sleepwalker\"Â </strong>is scheduled for release on the Unsacred Hearts' upcoming LPÂ <strong>The Honor Bar</strong>Â (due out in 20something onÂ <a href=\"http://www.seriousbusinessrecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Serious Business Records</a>). This, in contrast toÂ <strong>\"Fake Kisses,\"Â </strong>is a so-called \"jazzy song,\" and is a bit more representative of the band's \"new direction\" (see:Â Tap, Spinal (n.) new direction). Not to belittle the instrumental content in the slightest, but this tune is really carried byÂ <strong>Joe Willie's</strong>Â lyrics. The struggle of the Unsacred Hearts has always been how to properly frame the lyrical content while maintaining a consistent instrumental aesthetic. If \"Sleepwalker\" is any indication, they've finally mastered this balance onÂ <strong>The Honor Bar</strong>. Certain albums go best with a nice thick book of lyrics, and this is undoubtedly one of them. So, to save you the trouble of transcribing them yourself, there are the first two verses and the chorus:\r\n\r\n<em>I don't wanna stay in my bed so farewell avenue with yr beauty monitor\r\nFarewell Eveline with yer mother's sick jokes I am here no more I am here no more\r\nI felt my pulse in the dark the news was grim but I slept soundlyÂ then I rose at four\r\nTo gaze before the mirror in naked health it was dark I am invisible</em>\r\n\r\n<em>I get caught sleepwalking in the moonlight\r\nA riddle in the street in the middle of the night\r\nI get caught sleepwalking in the moonlight\r\nPeople think it's strange I think it's alright</em>\r\n\r\n<em>It makes funny story but this turbulent situation is no more\r\nNoon sun doldrums have settled like painkillers Einstein voted man of the century\r\nHe must be happy we must be happy for him and thank for his notions of timeÂ reverberating\r\nFrom the cellar to the attic keeping me up at night keeping me up at night</em>\r\n\r\nI've never been one for poetry, or really even lyrics, so when a lyricist commands my attention in a musical context, it means that something truly spectacular is going on. Jeff Mangum does that for me, so does Adrian Orange, and so doesÂ <strong>Joe Willie</strong>. So do yourself a favor and listen, I mean really listen, to what these guys have to say. It may not hook you on first listen, it may not hook you on second listen, but a lot of great literature doesn't exactly grab you by the collar and pull you in. It's like reading Ulysses--it might be a little hard to get into, but you'll be glad for the rest of your life that you made the effort and got through the sucker. It'll change how you see the world, and if you're lucky, how the world sees you back. So have a listen, and get into it.",

		"content" : "It took me several listens to really get insideÂ <strong>The Milkman's Union</strong>.Â  Yes, it sounded like good, independently produced rock music.Â  You know, electric guitars, wordy lyrics, drums that lingered somewhere between time keeping and expressionist flourishes.Â  It wasn't until I sat down exhausted in a darkening room and stared out at the heavy blue skies of early winter evening while hearing the lineÂ <em>\"I drove home in a long line of cars\"Â </em>listlessly intoned by singerÂ <strong>Henry Jamison</strong>Â that it all clicked into place.Â  It's all there in that one image: the highway at night (has to be night), the long line of beat little cars with their beat little drivers staring straight ahead, moving in bleak unison, oozing worms of light out into the blue that blink over the desiccated skeletons of winter trees each time the road bends.Â  The heavy crunch of tires on the gravel driveway and the sudden yawning silence when the engine is cut.Â  That moment of no thought when the driver disappears somewhere even he doesn't know, just before he clanks the seatbelt and steps through the silence and into the house, each footstep's sound hanging crisp in the cold air.Â  Melancholy.Â  Not sure how I ever missed it.Â  The Milkman's Union is lousy with it, and it's the weary, faded blue of those winter skies, not to mention most of the music I lost myself in during my lonely high school years.\r\n\r\n<strong>Jamison</strong>, who started the project in high school as a solo affair before being joined byÂ <strong>Peter McLaughlin</strong>,Â <strong>Sean Weathersby</strong>, andÂ <strong>Akiva Zamcheck</strong>, lists Ben Gibbard as a main influence, and you can hear it in thatÂ <strong>The Milkman's Union</strong>Â are young educated folk making highly accessible, deeply melancholy pop rock with a literary bent.Â  But where Gibbard is goopy and schoolboyish, there's something academic and world weary about Jamison's dry vocals.Â  It threw me at first, but now I like it.Â  It doesn't have the clean purity of Gibbard's voice, but clean purity gets boring pretty fast, and there's something addictive about the wispy airiness of Jamison's singing.Â  Perhaps it has to do with the fact that someone who sounds so tired can never sound maudlin or dramatic.Â  It's hard to pin down.Â Â  At times it seems like his voice isn't even there, like it's a ghost telling you about the marigolds in the hair of some long ago lover (those are lyrics. I'm not being pretentious anymore).Â  In fact, there is an air of wilting, 1920s decadence that permeates the entireÂ <strong>Roads In</strong>Â album from which these tracks are lifted.Â  Someone's always pouring a drink (and it's never beer), and the songs' narrators are constantly readingÂ  (<em>I read a little book on the origin of man</em>) and delivering wryly nasty punchlines (<em>how many gentlemen does it take to screw you in?</em>).Â  I mean, the former two are the main activities in college, so it makes sense, and maybe the song about the 1919 White Sox scandal is tainting my thoughts, but there's just something old-fashioned sounding about a band who uses a phrase likeÂ <em>I've been duped again</em>Â as a chorus.\r\n\r\n<strong>Jamison</strong>, in his blurb for the band, identifies this era ofÂ <strong>The Milkman's Union</strong>Â as a point in an evolution, and he's exactly right.Â  There are periodic moments of uncertainty, things you'd expect from such a young band.Â  A sudden lurch of the tempo, like driving over a speedbump, or a word at the end of a line left floating awkwardly.Â  Yet these things don't disturb the mood, which is the meat of the music.Â  The vocals are always hinting at the large, aching emotions of the musical backdrops, but they refuse to go there themselves.Â  Note that the big climax ofÂ <strong>A-side â€œRoads Inâ€</strong>Â comes sans vocals.Â Â <strong>Zamcheck's</strong>Â winding, modal guitar solo steps forward to provide catharsis.Â  Jamison's voice never ever rises above a mutter, and the lyrics remain elusive, but sometimes the violent house-cleaning kind of confession is far less interesting than the disquieting odds and ends that we're given here.Â  There's a mystery there that's alluring.Â  It's not the girl who throws her cleavage in your face every chance she gets, it's the one who hardly even looks at you, but every once in a while maybe you catch her in a little surreptitious glance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Peter McLaughlin's</strong>Â shimmery drums are a crucial element to this mystery, drawing heavily from non-rock musical traditions in a way that keeps their music from ever getting bogged down in its own emotional weight, which is all too easy for this kind of melancholia.Â  The latin-tinged mallets that commenceÂ <strong>â€œRoads Inâ€</strong>Â are an open sky where a backbeat would have been a closed door.Â  They keep the listener uncertain while pushing the time forward, and so does the asymmetry behind the second verse.Â  Over onÂ <strong>B-side â€œEmerald Flaresâ€</strong>Â the prim jazz brushes neatly buoy the song up, keeping it floating and airy.Â  This lightness is crucial in music with such a pervasive sadness, and it's surprisingly difficult to accomplish, since of course it must sound effortless.\r\n\r\nI could describe the songs in greater detail, talk about the sweetly melodic bass and hazy lead lines coasting over<strong>Â â€œEmerald Flaresâ€</strong>, the drumless Yo La Tengo-y (think â€œGreen Arrowâ€) interludes inÂ <strong>â€œRoads Inâ€</strong>Â that seem to hang in the air like slow-motion footage of something thrown aloft, but I don't think I need to.Â  The music conjures up its own cloud of mood the moment it comes on.Â  Just try to listen at dusk.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

		"content" : "When a band decides to call itselfÂ <strong>I'm Not a Band</strong>, it's kind of like a bear coming out of the woods and sayingÂ <em>\"I'm not a bear.\"</em>Â The first thing you think is,Â <em>\"Yeah right, prove it.\"</em>Â Then the next thing you think is,Â <em>â€œHoly shit! That bear just talked!â€</em>Â So in this case, when some German guy with a synthesizer and a violin and a pretty lady on vocals tell you that theyâ€™re not a band, try and suppress that gut instinct that, well, they look like a band, and sound like a band, and, who knows, probably smell like a band, and focus instead on the less obvious point: Why are they telling me anything at all? To this question, I think, there is always only one answer: they have something to hide.\r\n\r\nElectronic music does interesting things to peopleâ€™s identities. Perhaps it's something about sheer incomprehensibility of the racks of ridiculous machinery covered in knobs and screens and buttons that most DJs carry around: as Tom Waits said,Â <em>â€œWhatâ€™s he building in there?â€</em>Â While not everyone may be able play guitar or drums, at least most people understand how those instruments work: bang on this, hit these strings with a pick, letâ€™s move on. But unlike bands that futz around on standard hardware, electronic musicians tend to cloak their technique in all kinds of secrecy to the point where alienation from the process of musical production becomes both point of the style and its barometer for coolness. Have you ever seen anyone do an air-ADSR-envelope-tweak? No, because a) it would look idiotic, and b) who the fuck knows what an ADSR envelope is?Â <strong>Iâ€™m Not a Band</strong>, on the other hand, whose sweet brand of blippy/bloopy electropop certainly qualifies, at least in theory, for the electronica cloak-of-mystery, decides instead to turn up the TMI envelope.\r\n\r\nSo hereâ€™s the story.Â <strong>Stephan J.</strong>Â is born to a pair of professional German musicians and is subsequently classically trained on violin. In 2005, he moves to England, is wowed by club culture, and switches his primary axe to the laptop.Â <strong>Jana D.</strong>Â joins the project in 2009, and the pair proceed to perform, win a MySpace best-new-band competition, and release some groovy material. Interesting here is not necessarily the bildungsroman of a German violin prodigy transformed into a rampaging techno star by the Londonâ€™s bright lights and pulsing subwoofers, but the fact that the group wears this cultural cross-over on its sleeve. In a genre where obscuring poses, from Daft Punkâ€™s robot hats, to Crystal Castles blinding strobe light blasts, are the order of the day,Â <strong>Iâ€™m Not a Band</strong>Â has opted for something else: transparency. See this violin?, says Stephan, Iâ€™m going to play it in an electro band. Hear these complex harmonies and non-conventional song structures and intricate dynamics? Those are there because Iâ€™m a classical musician from Germany. There is a stunning honesty to these caveats, and a stunning payoff as well: these two tracks, despite the biography behind them, are big-time stunners.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œCrazy,â€</strong>Â strikes a fascinating balance between off-kilter pop somewhere in the vicinity of another violin-toting group, The Raincoats, and the synth-stomp of a less linear Matt and Kim. Iâ€™m not exactly sure if this is club musicâ€”it may be a bit too jittery for nonstop floor actionâ€”but it certainly sets up a cool flipside to IDM-style braindancing. WhereÂ <em>â€œintelligenceâ€</em>Â in the world of groups like Autechre or Aphex Twin translates into technical difficultyâ€”the programmerâ€™s equivalent of guitar shreddingâ€”<strong>Iâ€™m Not a Band</strong>Â imagines a kind of electro art-pop that engages the higher functions and the amygdala simultaneously. Passages are unpredictable, variations plentiful. Dance smarter, seems to be the message, but still dance.\r\n\r\nThe second, vocal-less trackÂ <strong>â€œThis Is It,â€</strong>Â is a slightly more straightforward bit of chiptune bounce, warm, interweaving arpeggiated synths that remind me a bit of what someone like Pink Stallone would do if trained in the Suzuki method. The title of the tune, while seemingly innocuous, is actually something of a call to arms: ifÂ <strong>â€œCrazyâ€Â </strong>dabs little bits ofÂ <strong>Iâ€™m Not a Bandâ€™s</strong>Â storied violin noncommittally around the composition, this song puts the fiddle, so to speak, in the middle. See this violin, saysÂ <strong>Stephan</strong>. This is it! Indeed, about three minutes in, strains of strings begin to creep into the pulse like some kind of phantom baroque radio station and start getting louder. Itâ€™s a cool effect--by the trackâ€™s end, synth and violin have essentially exchanged prominence in the mix. Stephan, the orchestra boy seduced by big beats and sequencers, seems to have come full circle.\r\n\r\nBut hereâ€™s the big question, and the one that goes back to my first point about having something to hide. Is there any difference betweenÂ <strong>Iâ€™m Not a Bandâ€™s</strong>Â Iâ€™m a Real Violin, and any other electronic artistâ€™s employment of a string-section preset on a Korg? No, I think, but also yes.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s why. In the age of Ableton, any recorded sound can be quantized, chopped up, synchronized with a beat, and manipulated to resemble any other sound. So, in terms of actual sonics, what we hear on the record,Â <strong>Iâ€™m Not a Bandâ€™s</strong>Â violin, by virtue of their electropop meme, is essentially meaningless. Iâ€™m trusting that these guys use a real violin, but when it comes to this kind of thing, trust is all we can go on.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,Â <strong>Iâ€™m Not a Bandâ€™s</strong>Â mere insistence upon this biographical detail is necessary to maintaining their own procedural mystery. The violin, we can say, is the equivalent of the Daft Punk helmet. So what, then, are Iâ€™m Not a Band hiding? The fact that they have nothing to hide.",

		"content" : "The world of sound is a strange one, indeed. Think about it. We pay money to watch people make sounds. If people make really cool sounds, we pay more money. Iâ€™ve heard people make some pretty cool sounds in my day. But itâ€™s all a hoax. I sincerely regret to inform you that the current sound world you inhabit is limited, a sham. After all, thereâ€™s a potentially infinite combination of sonic textures to be tapped. If itâ€™s in the range of human hearing, we should be able to hear it. The problem, however, is that thereâ€™s a finite number of instruments in the world. The objects we have for realizing sound potential are inherently limited.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the many reasons why experimental instrument design is such a vital field in music. Instrument designers are like musical scientists, forging new vehicles for the manifestation of previously unimaginable timbres. If the potential sound world is limited, then there must be a whole range of textures waiting to be uncovered. Jon Scoville, in his introduction to Bart Hopkinâ€™s useful Musical Instrument Design, waxes philosophic on the matter:Â <em>â€œThere is an ancient imperative lodged in our DNA which asks us to make music. Our intuitive understanding of being alive on this blue planet is most poetically expressed in our songs and dances. In our instinct to organize sound and movement we fully express both the ambiguities and certainties of life. Making the instruments that make the music that makes the soundtracks to our lives is one of the ways that we reconnect ourselves with the world and with our ancient heritage. Thus we join that long tradition of (mostly) unknown instrument makers who gave birth to drums, violins, lutes, bamboo zithers, steel drums, gamelan, and the countless other instruments that produce our planetâ€™s songs and symphoniesâ€</em>Â (iii).\r\n\r\nWe can now add to that list the daxophone, a friction idiophone invented by German musician and typographer Hans Reichel. Pictured withÂ <strong>Dandelion Fiction</strong>Â above, itâ€™s essentially composed of a variety of thin wooden blades (orÂ <em>â€œtonguesâ€</em>) inserted into a wooden block, which is in turn amplified by small contact microphones. The tongues are then bowed with a horsehair bow and bent to alter pitch.Â <strong>Daniel Fishkin</strong>, the brains behind Dandelion Fiction, is one of the few daxophone players you will ever meet. He learned how to play and design this unique instrument under Mark Stewart, an instrument designer, founding member of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, and ensemble musician for Steve Reich and Arnold Dreyblatt. The sound of the daxophone can be accurately described as mammals mating (this could be why one of the songs on the 2008 Dandelion Fiction LPÂ <strong>Youâ€™re A Strong One</strong><em>Â </em>is called â€œBadger Thumpinâ€™.â€)\r\n\r\nCheck outÂ <strong>A-side â€œLeg Shimmyâ€</strong>Â for a glimpse into the world of the daxophone. The instrumentâ€™s vocal quality is immediately apparent here, particularly in the songâ€™s first few seconds where the pitches jump around so much as to sound like a muffled reproduction of a conversation. The track quickly settles into a fun little groove, proving that you can be on the cutting edge of 21<sup>st</sup>Â century music and still have a sense of humor. Towards the end of the song, a mysterious drone is introduced. Is it feedback? A tape? Frankly Mr. Shankly, it matters not. Sometimes the mystery of sound can be as important as the exact documentation of its production. This couldnâ€™t be more true for the epic nightmare-techno ofÂ <strong>B-side â€œUnravel With Ease.â€</strong>Â I could spend all week trying to figure out how all the sounds here were produced, but Iâ€™d rather let it pummel me with its Stravinksy-like syncopation and relentless pounding. Thereâ€™s definitely something to letting the sounds occur without further investigation. The songâ€™s directions are pretty clear.\r\n\r\nAlthough the similarities betweenÂ <strong>Dandelion Fiction</strong>Â and Animal Collective are scant, they have some interesting things to say on the topic of divulging sound information. Quoth Avey Tare:Â <em>â€œPart of the mystery of a lot of the bands we like was their ability to create really special sonic environments. It was something that made us think and inspired us to make music of our own. If you just spend a lot of time telling, especially younger people, what you're doing and how everything is done, you feel like you're not going to push people to experiment on their own and try to figure things out on their own. And I think that's another good thing about not saying what we're doing all the time.â€</em>Â Indeed, if music and experimental instrument design are about discovery, then an element of mystery is the perfect catalyst for exploration. Keep us in the loop, I say, but not too close.",

		"content" : "Generally I write about bands but today I'm going to write about an album,Â <strong>Cold Duck Complex Presents Freshwater: Bad Love</strong>. Skirting the gray area between solo album and full band release, Bad Love is a collaborative effort, the musical voice ofÂ <strong>Joe Cardozo</strong>Â (aliasÂ <strong>Freshwater</strong>) filtered through the hip-hop/rock/jazz machine that for the last 7 years has been calledÂ <strong>Cold Duck Complex</strong>. Our story begins in Amherst, MA in 2002 when the Cold Duck Trio, a jazz and funk group featuring Cardozo on bass,Â <strong>Makaya McCraven</strong>Â on drums, andÂ <strong>Jeff Dâ€™Antona</strong>Â on keys, began collaborating with rapperÂ <strong>Platypus Complex</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe first time I sawÂ <strong>Cold Duck Complex</strong>Â play was in the winter of 2004 in my high school gymnasium. It was a pretty thin crowd, maybe 40 or 50 kids standing around with their hands in their pockets, not really getting into the groove. A lackluster sound system, shitty acoustics, and faculty chaperones sipping coffee in the corner didnâ€™t contribute much to the mood. But in spite of the uninspiring ambiance, I was floored. Cold Duck Complex grabbed my ear and wouldnâ€™t let go.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, that was a long time ago. I was an impressionable seventeen-year-old with a budding interest in jazz which seemed completely at odds with my secret love for hip hop. By hip hop, I really mean main stream chart topping MTV jams because this was before I delved into the wide world of underground hip hop. I was confused. I hated popular music on principle. I had recently begun playing the bass, and consequently viewed funk as the pinnacle of musical evolution. I spent my days salivating at Jaco Pastorius and Victor Wooten solos. I couldnâ€™t respect a genre in which the music took a back seat and the vocalist got all the glory, but something about hip hop moved me.\r\n\r\nAnd then I sawÂ <strong>Cold</strong>Â <strong>Duck Complex</strong>. This wasnâ€™t some guy spitting raps over an uninspired sampled beat. It was a funk band with a rapper.Â <strong>Platypus Complex</strong>Â knew how to tear up the mic, but he also knew when to step down and let the band indulge in a ten-minute extended funk jam. And jam they can. The nameÂ <strong>Cold Duck Trio</strong>Â is a nod to the jazz standard \"Cold Duck Time\" by Eddie Harris so as you might expect the band is well schooled in jazz and funk. Moreover, they play together with incredible synergy, each member an astute listener and participant a musical conversation.Â <em>Eureka</em>.\r\n\r\nNow that I dwell on it, I might have been one of those kids with my hands in my pockets but if I was, it wasnâ€™t for lack of enthusiasm. If I wasnâ€™t dancing, itâ€™s because I was straining to catch every word, every note. And Iâ€™m pretty sure I was nodding in silent agreement. After the show I picked up a copy ofÂ <strong>Figure Heads</strong>Â and popped it into my player the second I got back to my room. It stayed there for months. And although my musical tastes have evolved considerably over the past 5 years,Â <strong>Cold Duck Complex</strong>Â is one band that Iâ€™ve kept coming back to.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re gonna likeÂ <strong>Cold Duck Complex</strong>Â you have to accept the fact that this is a white boy rapping. And yes, he does sound a little like Eminem, at least until you listen to what heâ€™s saying. ButÂ <strong>Platypus Complex</strong>Â is one of my favorite lyricists out there. His rhymes are sometimes profound, sometimes goofy, but always clever and delivered with impeccable flow. And in an era where both culture (pop stars) and counter culture (hipsters) are obsessed with image, itâ€™s refreshing that Platapus Complex doesnâ€™t try to be somebody heâ€™s not.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œI ainâ€™t wholesome authenticity trip for hip hop, aight? I grew up in a town without a stoplight.â€</em>\r\n\r\nAnd so I was pretty disappointed in 2007 when the band started to dissolve. FirstÂ <strong>Dâ€™Antona</strong>Â left the group. He was replaced byÂ <strong>Darby Wolf</strong>Â but before longÂ <strong>McCraven</strong>Â moved west to Chicago, whileÂ <strong>Cardozo</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Platypus Complex</strong>Â headed south to New York. AlthoughÂ <strong>Cold Duck Complex</strong>Â had acquired a solid fan base throughout the northeastern United States and Europe, logistics made regular collaboration and performance impossible.\r\n\r\nAnd then from the dustÂ <strong>Freshwater</strong>Â was born.Â <strong>CardozoÂ </strong>was offered a grant by friend and studio/venue owner Ed Wierzbowski of the Art and Music Factory which allowed him to dedicate himself fully to his musical endeavors. He proposed to his band mates that he take the lead on a project focused on his work as a producer and composer and they agreed. So it began. Two years later, in July 2009,Â <strong>Cold Duck Complex Presents Freshwater: Bad LoveÂ </strong>was released.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cardozo</strong>Â composed most of the music on the album but all members ofÂ <strong>Cold Duck Complex</strong>Â added their own touches. Cardozo explains,Â <em>â€œwhether someone plays a part I came up with or not, they always add their own flavor to it.â€</em>\r\n\r\nEssentially,Â <strong>Freshwater</strong>Â is what happens when you takeÂ <strong>Platypus Complex</strong><strong>â€™s</strong>Â unique lyricism and flow along with the funky instrumentals of the Cold Duck trio and pimp them out in the studio. Extra vocals, more instruments, and a masterful production job make for a big sound. The epic builds thatÂ <strong>Cold Duck Complex</strong>Â hinted at in songs like Lucky Me, are executed to extremes under the umbrella of Freshwater. Itâ€™s often over the top, but thatâ€™s part of the fun. The chiller numbers sound a bit like G Love n Special Sauce, the heavy and often politically charged numbers approach Rage Against the Machine, and the sexually charged funk jams are reminiscent of vintage Red Hot Chili Peppers.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side \"They Donâ€™t Wanna Dance\"</strong>Â most closely falls into the first category. A catchy instrumental hook, tight beat, and picked bass provide ample momentum in this laid back jam. Normally Iâ€™m skeptical of any rapper that spends to long talking about rap, but in this case I think it works pretty well. For the most part, itâ€™s reflective rather than egotistical. One of my favorite lines â€”Â <em>â€œto the melody of my melancholy machine, I do my best to forget what I mean.â€</em>Â The chorus expands uponÂ <strong>Platypus</strong><strong>â€™s</strong>Â personal chronicles, lamenting the way so many musicians take themselves too seriously and have forgotten how to have fun.Â <em>â€œThey donâ€™t wanna dance no more, they just wanna watch the clock tick.â€</em>Â And dance is exactly whatÂ <strong>FreshwaterÂ </strong>does (in a metaphorical sense) in the songâ€™s triumphant ending which features a peppy trumpet section and Alecia Chakourâ€™s one woman gospel choir.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"Coming Home\"</strong>Â is lyrically a bit more edgy.Â <strong>Platypus Complex</strong>Â gets up on his soapbox does some old fashioned preaching, weaving extended metaphor after extended metaphor.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œBeen a prisoner of flesh, a servant to nerve endings\r\nA straight and narrow arrow in a curve bending\r\nBeen the archer and the target, the marcher and the carpet\r\nThe civilian and the sergeant following free marketsâ€</em>\r\n\r\nAt first his message seems political, but in the final line of the first verse he shifts directions â€”Â <em>â€œBut all Iâ€™m trying to say is Iâ€™ve never been in love like I love you today.â€</em>Â In context, it sounds as if heâ€™s confessing his love for the music. And so, itâ€™s only natural that the last two minutes the music pushes its way to the front of the mix. Again,Â <strong>CardozoÂ </strong>builds another epic ending in the studio. Perhaps this one takes it overboard, with stadium-rock drum fills and more stacked vocals from Chakour. But I love the soaring bass solo (if such a thing isnâ€™t an oxymoron) which rises to the top despite by being drowned in fuzzy effects. Itâ€™s the great transition into the end, a quiet fizzle, which fades without a bang, making it hard to delineate where the music stops. A perfect choice for the final cut on the album.\r\n\r\nIn short, kudos toÂ <strong>Cardozo</strong>Â for taking the initiative and keeping things going (and I truly mean going, not just maintaining theÂ <em>status quo</em>) despite the geographic distance. All I can say is that I hopeÂ <strong>Freshwater</strong>Â doesnâ€™t remain exclusively a studio project, because this kind of music is so much fun to see live.",

		"content" : "<strong>Boca Chica</strong>Â is a Pittsburgh based indie-folk band in the vein of Sufjan Stevens, Neil Young, Arcade Fire, Joanna Newsom, Gillian Welch, etc, etc... I use the term band, but in reality Boca Chica functions more like a collective.Â  Itâ€™s a rotating cast of characters jamming along to the songs ofÂ <strong>Hallie Pritts</strong>.Â  Boca Chica began in 2004 as a duet featuring Pritts (vocals, guitar) andÂ <strong>Susanna Meyer</strong>Â (bass, vocals, flute).Â  Since then, the group has grown at a healthy clip.Â  In addition to Pritts and Meyer, their latest albumÂ <strong>Lace Up Your Workboots</strong>Â featuresÂ <strong>Jeff Baron</strong>Â (guitar, banjo)Â <strong>Christopher McDonald</strong>, (keys, banjo, guitar, vibes, vocals, synths, sounds),Â Â <strong>Lisa Campbell</strong>Â (Cello),Â <strong>Matt Miller</strong>Â (Drums, Vocals),Â <strong>Jeff Ryan</strong>Â (Drums),Â <strong>James Hart</strong>Â (Pedal Steel, Vocals),Â <strong>Dave Flaherty</strong>Â (auxiliary percussion ),Â <strong>Drew Ceccato</strong>Â (Electronic Valve Instrument).Â  Theyâ€™ve recently picked up a new drummer,Â <strong>Ricky Moslen</strong>, who does not appear on Lace Up Your Workboots but will appear on the next album.Â  And itâ€™s not uncommon for additional friends, including the entire cast ofÂ <a href=\"http://www.ampeatermusic.com/aem021\">Cuddle Magic</a>, to join them on stage.Â  You get the picture.Â  With eleven-plus members and twenty-something instruments between them, the permutations are pretty much endless.The nameÂ <strong>Boca Chica</strong>Â (Spanish for Little Mouth) was chosen on a somewhat of a whim.Â Â <strong>Pritts</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Meyer</strong>Â were slated to perform at a folk festival and thinking that â€œPritts &amp; Meyerâ€ sounded too much likeÂ <em>â€œold man jazzâ€</em>Â they decided to choose something new, eventually settling on Boca Chica.Â  There wasnâ€™t a lot of thought behind it, but Boca Chica is a more fitting name than Pritts and Meyer could have possibly imagined at the time.Â  Why?Â  Because for an eleven member collective, perhaps the most striking thing about Boca Chica is that they know how to shut up.Â  Really.Â  Often large ensembles fall into the trap of trying to play over one another rather than with each other but not so with Boca Chica.Â  They never step on each others toes.Â  This band literally can go to eleven, but usually they hover around four or five, and sometimes bringing it all the way down to one.Â  The dynamic range is astounding.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side \"Lake Erie\"</strong>Â is the first cut offÂ <strong>Lace Up Your Workboots</strong>Â and the albumâ€™s most obvious hit single.Â  Itâ€™s gotten moderate radio play in recent months, reaching #16 on the Roots charts and #2 on the Pennsylvania Roots Chartsâ€”<em>â€œyes, that actually exists,â€Â </em><strong>Pritts</strong>Â admits with a chuckleâ€”and itâ€™s easy to understand why.Â  Itâ€™s accessible but not in an overly familiar way, and memorable enough to prompt repeat listens.Â  The tune begins with a softly plucked banjo riff, later mirrored on acoustic guitar.Â  Drums sneak in and then Prittsâ€™s soprano pierces through the mix.Â  An ascending cello line creeps in at the B theme (<em>â€œI met a dog, he stole my song</em>â€¦â€) providing just enough harmonic motion to tear the heartstrings.Â  AndÂ <strong>McDonald</strong><strong>â€™s</strong>Â shimmering vibes make for a nice musical interlude before an impressive climax.Â  Iâ€™m not talking about climax in a cheap Hollywood sense.Â  Iâ€™m talking about climax as a dramatic technique, aÂ <em>â€œdecisive turning point in the actionâ€</em>Â or the moment from which the outcome becomes inevitable.Â  As soon that persistent 8<sup>th</sup>-note snare kicks in at around 2:25, a build is put in motion.Â  An orchestra kicks inâ€”cello and elegantly bowed upright bassâ€”before the song finally erupts out of necessity into a quiet refrain.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œOut in the dark and dead of night\r\nI dug a hole, for to leave behind\r\nBut by the morningâ€™s piercing rays\r\nShow that some things though buried\r\nDo not decayâ€¦â€</em>\r\n\r\nUltimately,Â <strong>\"Lake Erie\"</strong>Â is nothing short of whatÂ <strong>Pritts</strong>Â describes it as:Â <em>â€œa heavily orchestrated song about death.â€</em>Â And what could be more fun than that?\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"Like Sheep in the Night\"</strong>Â is a little more out there.Â  When I first heard the title \"Like Sheep in the Night\" I imagined a bizarre hybrid of Frank Sinatraâ€™s Strangers in the Night and an insomnia-induced mental breakdown.Â  Not quite, but the result is equally intriguing.Â  First of all, the lyrics are primarily in French, with selected lines in English.Â Â <strong>Pritts</strong>Â used to live in France and had been toying with the idea of writing a songÂ <em>en francais</em>Â for a while.Â Â Â <em>â€œItâ€™s kind of silly and a real French person would probably scoff at it because it doesnâ€™t make a ton of sense,â€</em>Â she admits, â€œ<em>but I liked the way the words went together.Â  Itâ€™s vaguely about wandering around a French city looking for an open bar.â€</em>Â Like sheep in the nightâ€¦\r\n\r\n<em>â€œLes moutons de la nuit\r\nTrouvent mes yeux remplis\r\nOh bien dormi!\r\nKeep on evading me.â€</em>\r\n\r\nOr, a significantly less poetic English translation:\r\n\r\n<em>â€œSheep in the night\r\nFind my eyes full\r\nOh good sleep\r\nKeep on evading meâ€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Meyerâ€™s</strong>Â vocal harmonies add a lot to the mix, emphasizing the last line in each stanza.Â  But oddly enough, for a French song, the music is decidedly American.Â  The pedal steel guitar and classic three chord progression scream country.Â  The solo section is yet another beautiful anomaly.Â  I call it a solo section, but these arenâ€™t solosâ€”theyâ€™re just a few notes.Â  First, a melodica blast. Then, little electric piano blips reveal a funkier side to the song that the band flirts with without fully indulging in.Â  Everything a solo should be, minus the solo.\r\n\r\nSo whatâ€™s next forÂ <strong>Boca Chica</strong>?Â  Brian Krasman describesÂ <strong>Lace Up Your WorkbootsÂ </strong>asÂ <em>â€œa top-notch, major-league record that easily and rightfully should be their ticket out of town and onto the roster of a major indie label.â€</em>Â I couldnâ€™t agree more.Â  The entire album is mellow gold.Â  Backseat will send you into a reflective stupor and Valentineâ€™s epic ending will build you back up again.Â Â  As for being a ticket out of town, so far the band seems content with their surroundings, but hopes to expand their gigging radius.Â  Record labels take note.",

		"content" : "Okay, so today I am going to tell you about three young Brooklynites playing pop music that draws heavily from Ghanaian highlife and Congolese soukouss and I'm going to ask you not to sneer.Â  I mean, let's all put aside our kneejerk Vampire Weekend Paul Simon reflexes and think about this for a second.Â  Why do we feel like we're supposed to look down on such things?Â  Usually it is a question of authenticity, connected to some imagined exploitation or imperialistic colonization of styles of music and musicians from the third world.Â  First of all, let me just throw some wrenches into this authenticity thing.Â  I mean, it's almost too easy.Â  The idea that there is some racially pure music out there is just ridiculous, and the idea that it would be somehow more real (what does that even mean?) or automatically better than any of the countless hybrids we have is just kind of stupid.Â  Highlife itselfÂ  was already a fusion of Western and African music back in the 1930s when it emerged.Â  According to afropop.org, it wasÂ <em>a blend of Trinidadian calypso, military brass band music, Cuban son and older African song forms</em>Â with the addition of American swing music a decade later during WWII.Â  Do you have an urge to go back to Ghana 1941 and sneer at them for defiling their culture with swing music?Â  See how silly this all is?Â  Highlife was never anything but a hybrid, one piece of dialogue in the eternal conversation of culture.Â  I may be out on a limb here but I'd say there is something way more imperialistically iffy and patronizing about wanting to quarantine various foreign musics in order to preserve them like museum pieces (read: kill them) than there is about oh, I dunno, going to Ghana and learning how to play some of their music and then letting it into your own, which is what theÂ <strong>King Expressers</strong>Â have done.Â  Culture is only alive when it is changing and growing, kids.\r\n\r\nNow, I just wasted your time, because the second you hear this music, you are not going to give a rat's ass about authenticity.Â  You are going to be too busy chairdancing in front of your laptop.Â  TheÂ <strong>King Expressers</strong>Â are primarily guitaristÂ <strong>Mikey Hart</strong>, bassistÂ <strong>Nikhil P. Yerawadekar</strong>, and drummerÂ <strong>Rich Levinson</strong>, though on these recordings they are joined by an enormous horn section (nine pieces!) and two backup vocalists (Hart and Yerawadekar share primary vocal duties).Â  Their music is often sort of like a sped-up version of soukouss, as they say, and it has the chiming, polyphonic guitars that American rock bands tend to lift from Afropop, but really it is a soup of all sorts of influences.Â  There is, for example, that snare hit about a minute intoÂ <strong>A-side â€œPassed Ascension Parishâ€</strong>Â that suddenly echoes expansively, nodding at the entire genre of dub reggae in about one second.Â  Or the asymmetry and freedom of form in both songs, resulting in time shifts, feel shifts, key shifts, etc.Â  There are even clear rock cousins, like Islands, who you almost expect to hear crooningÂ <em>â€œswans, swans, swans,â€</em>Â over the bass and guitar drone after the introduction toÂ <strong>â€œThe Real True Story.â€</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œPassed Ascension Parishâ€</strong>Â (which appears to be a Hurricane Katrina themed love song, and is in any case the happiest sounding Katrina-related song I have ever heard) kicks off with the kind of liquid, sunny guitars that we know and love from our previous Afropop experiences, lifted recently to great effect by scads of rock bands (Dirty Projectors, Islands, Vampire Weekend, a million more).Â  You can instantly hear how accomplished the musicians are here.Â  As a band, when you have musicians who can play anything they want without batting an eye, doors just open in every direction.Â  The vocals aren't showy, but they lock perfectly in tune and time and the band kicks right along underneath, answering occasionally with a little bass or guitar burst.Â  The kind of relaxed momentum theÂ <strong>King Expressers</strong>Â display here is the opposite of the frantic trampling of punk rock (which I also enjoy): it's the assured drive of people who are in total control.Â  This relaxed tightness is the exact thing that makes you want to dance.Â  When the choral vocals come in, though the words are about rain, the music is pure sun, so warm and light and easy.Â  This is the other beautiful thing about technique, it lets you make hard things sound easy.Â  Halfway through, the song revs up and leaps into a speedy soukouss feel (sounds like reggaeton to me, but I'm pretty green when it comes to this stuff) and the different melodies that just keep pouring out of the keyboards, guitars, horns and voices are almost overwhelming.Â  It's a euphoric moment that lasts for three whole minutes, all the way to the last horn and voice swell.Â  Like I said, pure sun.\r\n\r\nIfÂ <strong>â€œPassed Ascension Parishâ€</strong>Â is drinking a beer on the porch,Â <strong>B-side â€œThe Real True Storyâ€</strong>Â is going out to a house party later.Â  More upbeat and quickfooted, â€œThe Real True Storyâ€ starts with a nursery-rhyme simple melody (note the wayÂ <strong>Levinson</strong>Â plays the melody on the drums the first time through before busting into a skittery solo on the second repeat) and then builds all the way up through the bouncing verse melody into a fantastic horn breakdown with a wooly, howling baritone sax solo and some punchy brass fanfares.Â  Dig the madly leaping bass or the way that all the instruments unite to play the little descending line in the middle of each chorus.Â  Listening to the lyrics, which are pretty straight-forward love lyrics, show us how fully assimilated theÂ <strong>King Expressers</strong>Â influences are.Â  They aren't making music that is self-consciously foreign, they are making the music that comes naturally to them, about their lives.Â  There's nothing put on or gimmicky about it.Â  It's just amazing pop music that holds up perfectly to repeated listens (I'm going on number ten here and I'm still bobbing my head just the way I was on number one).\r\n\r\nOn both tracks, keep an eye out for the subtlety of the arrangements, which hold your hand all the way through each song so perfectly you'd never even notice.Â  New instruments are constantly emerging to reinforce the feeling of progress, to keep any section from simply being a repeat of something earlier.Â  The overlapping melodies at the end ofÂ <strong>â€œPassed Ascension Parishâ€</strong>Â or the synthy keyboard in the second verse of<strong>Â â€œThe Real True Storyâ€</strong>Â or the alto sax that jumps in for the last, what, two bars of the final chorus on the latter are perfect examples of how these guys areÂ <em>never</em>Â going to let their listeners get bored.Â  Sadly, these two songs comprise all the recordings to emerge from theÂ <strong>Expressers'</strong>Â loft in Brooklyn so far, but we can all hope there's more coming soon, and in the meantime we can stop our hiding our taste for rock bands with Afropop influences and start laughing off the authenticity police.Â  Or at the very least handing them a beer and telling them to dance.\r\n\r\n(Full Disclosure:Â <em>Graceland</em>Â is one of the author's favorite

		"content" : "<strong>Benji Cossa</strong>Â was once calledÂ <em>\"The King of Song\"</em>Â by Bjorn Copeland of the Black Dice. Other people that have been referred to as musical royalty include: Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Johnny Cash, not to mention Queens Aretha and Latifah, Ozzy the Prince of Darkness, and just plain old Prince--all popular artists that achieved massive radio success. Cossa heard his song played on the radio too. Once. He recalls,Â <em>\"They played 'April' on WFMU and I missed it. I didn't know it would be on, but I turned on the radio and heard my name. It was exciting.\"</em><strong>Benji Cossa</strong>, like many truly great songwriters, doesn'tÂ <em>\"write\"</em>Â songs in an active sense of the word. They just seem to spill out by the dozens--on train rides, at work, all the time. It's remarkable, and it's genuine. That isn't to say that he doesn't work hard. He's a craftsman, and he's very serious about his work. The man's prolific, but only a small cult of friends and fans can say that they've heard even one of his thousands of original compositions.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cossa's</strong>Â a complex and emotional individual, but there's nevertheless a certain element of simplicity that pervades his music. Well, to call it simplicity is to sell it a bit short because what we're really talking about here is innocence. There's more than a little bit of Daniel Johnston in him, if it's possible to draw the comparison without implying that Cossa's an acid-casualty-crazy-person (he isn't). That said, he's been making music almost as long as I've been alive, and still refers to guitar chords by shape: \"line\" (A major), \"triangle\" (D major), \"upside down triangle\" (D7), \"regular\" (that's \"G major\"), and my personal favorite, \"the hard one\" (meaning \"C major\"). His instruments are often a bit out of tune, and I'd wager that the whole concept of musicianship (you know, precision, sounding \"good\") that so many songwriters embrace as a crutch is the furthest thing from his mind during the creative process. Actually, Benji Cossa doesn't really have a creative process; his whole life is a creative process. He justÂ <em>does</em>, and fortunately for us what he does is really phenomenal. Part of it's the voice, that wonderful effortless voice. I once asked him whether a particular part happened to be sung in falsetto, to which he replied \"What's that?\". Seriously. He has no vocal break whatsoever, and makes use of more octaves than most pianists (Hyperbole, you say! Listen, I say).\r\n\r\n<strong>Cossa'sÂ </strong>songs are flexible shells, and translate well into a variety of formats. Whether it's his home recordingsÂ <strong><a href=\"http://seriousbusinessrecords.com/releases/show/36-Benji-Cossa-s-Vault-Vol-2-Jewels-and-Gems\" target=\"_blank\">(Benji Cossa's Vault Vol. 2)</a></strong>, acoustic popÂ <strong><a href=\"http://seriousbusinessrecords.com/releases/show/24-Between-the-Blue-and-the-Green\" target=\"_blank\">(Between the Blue and the Green)</a></strong>, or rollicking country rockÂ <strong><a href=\"http://seriousbusinessrecords.com/releases/show/42-Benji-Cossa-and-the-Tightens\" target=\"_blank\">(Benji Cossa &amp; The Tightens)</a></strong>, his melodic sense and complex world view shine through. His catalog is a veritableÂ <em>\"choose your own adventure\"</em>Â album, which made constructing this 7-inch a blast. What we have here today are some recordings made at the turn of the millennium on 4-track tape and 8-track cassette machines. But don't let the lo-fi aesthetic fool you, Cossa's not trying to fall in with the likes of Iron &amp; Wine or Devendra Banhart. His influences are more in the direction of ELO and the Doobie Brothers than anything deliberately DIY or folksy sounding. And for those who would draw the seemingly obvious Beatles parallel inspired by his soaring tenor, Cossa would respond withÂ <em>\"Beatles? Not that great.\"Â </em>There's no pretension to Cossa's incidental appropriation of the lo-fi aesthetic--it's merely a product of the tools that he had available to him at the time.\r\n\r\nBenji Cossa has a knack for writing beautiful and catchy pop tunes about some seriously heavy themes.Â <strong>A-side \"Superlow\"</strong>Â is a hook-ridden walk through the guilty pastures of someone's impulsive sexual exploits. It so effectively conjures the grit and depression of an adulterous encounter that I feel shitty just listening to it. But it pushes even further into the psyche, switching voices between some governing subconscious and the perpetrators themselves. The song opens in medias res, and the subconscious voice advisesÂ <em>\"If so, let yourself go,\"Â </em>to which the perpetrator responds with the rationalization,Â <em>\"We both need it, and why not? It'll be our little secret.\"</em>Â The subconscious voice then returns with the provocation,Â <em>\"Go on, go, go, go go go go!\"</em>Â The perpetrator, now sexed, reflects,Â <em>\"We set our sights super low, we made our beds and now we're lying, but it's not cheating.\"</em>Â Literary critics would have a field day with this, as the ensuing cacophony brought on by the song's multiple narrators allows it to possess a kind of intratextual discourse, and consequently assume layers of interactive meaning that would be otherwise impossible. In other words, this is some good shit.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Superlow\"</strong>Â was written in 2000, back whenÂ <strong>Cossa</strong>Â was living jobless in a spacious apartment in the now trendy Williamsburg, Brooklyn.Â  After blowing through his savings, he took on a job for $6.50 an hour at Petland Discount and moved to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood where he was promptly mugged at his front door. Finding more cockroaches than neighbors, he brought home aÂ <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokay_gecko\" target=\"_blank\">Tokay gecko</a>Â named \"Creepers\" to rectify the situation. His room was barely large enough for a bed and a dresser. It was around this time that Cossa began his love affair with WCBS FM, the New York classic rock (50s-70s) radio station that played day in and day out at Petland. Most (if not all) of Cossa's music has deep roots in WCBS FM's top 40 lists. It's with this mindset (shitty apartment, shitty job, classic rock) that we approachÂ <strong>\"Life Might Be In Vain.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nNow, from the above description you might assume thatÂ <strong>B-side \"Life Might Be In Vain\"Â </strong>is aboutÂ <em>\"the artist\"</em>Â and his struggle to function within the bounds of a society that doesn't fully appreciate his craft. But, this is where you'd be wrong. It's actually about zombies. A friend happened to be making a film about a zombie invasion and askedÂ <strong>CossaÂ </strong>to contribute to the soundtrack. The premise toÂ <strong>\"Life Might Be In Vain\"</strong>Â is this: the main character's girlfriend has abandoned him and he laments that without her love, he might as well get bitten and turn into a zombie. Cossa insists that most of his songs, even those with deeply personal themes, are merely his quirky take on humanity's problems. Only a handful are directly relevant to his own struggles and triumphs.Â <strong>\"Life Might Be In Vain\"</strong>Â has a certain comfortable lilt and off-kilter vocal style that might seem oddly familiar to those of you who've heard Bob Dylan &amp; The Band's \"Basement Tapes.\" It's Cossa on every instrument here, testing the waters in a style and groove that would resurface in a major way on hisÂ <strong>Benji Cossa &amp; The Tightens</strong>Â record.\r\n\r\nNot enough people listen toÂ <strong>Benji Cossa's</strong>Â music, period. We're working damn hard, hand in hand with the folks atÂ <a href=\"http://seriousbusinessrecords.com/artists/show/12\" target=\"_blank\">Serious Business Records</a>Â to change this.Â <em>So go on, go, go, go go, go</em>Â listen to some Benji Cossa.",

		"content" : "I always get a bit concerned when an artist claims, likeÂ <strong>Andy J Gallagher</strong>Â does, to possess aÂ <em>â€œlonging, homage, respect, and love for the glory daysâ€</em>Â of something, especially punk rock. Not only does nostalgia make people sound old, but the very idea of the â€œglory daysâ€ of anything as amorphous and fickle as punk is ludicrous: less a genre than an ideology, punk has always been more about breaking things and creating monsters out of the detritus than a particular sound or style.Â <em>â€œFuck history,â€</em>Â some collective mega-ghost of Joe Strummer, the MC5 , Iggy Pop and Penny Rimbaud might say,Â <em>â€œGimme danger instead.â€</em>On the other hand, despite the fact that everything can become punkâ€”a rendition of Handelâ€™s Messiah sung into a beer can, for exampleâ€”not everything that says itâ€™s punk actually is. Itâ€™s one of those know-it-when-you-hear-it kind of things: Afrika Bambaataa, Bob Dylan, Minor Threat, Slayer...all totally punk. AndÂ <strong>Andy J Gallagher</strong>, backwards-looking or not, certainly sounds punk. Itâ€™s abstract. But is it enough?\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s the gist:Â <strong>Gallagher</strong>, who looks like an actor playing Lou Reed in a hypothetical Berlin: The Movie and is not, I believe, related to either of the Oasis bros, gigged around London for a few years with the brilliantly titled bandÂ <strong>The Shopkeeper Appeared</strong>, showing up on the BBC and playing support slots for Radiohead before ditching the fame-and-fortune route to conduct extensive research on international musical culture with some buddies. Ethnomusicological foray in the bag, the intrepid Brit returned home to dig deeper into his nationâ€™s own version of Congolese war drumming: two-minute guitar rock songs. When Roman Jugg, a back-in-the-day keyboardist for the Damned (definitely punk) heard the tapes, he decided to man the decks for Gallagherâ€™s perplexingly dubbed full-lengthÂ <strong>Helicopter Dolphin Submarine</strong>. The songs here are taken from that record.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s the archetypal rock nâ€™ roll narrative, almost too much so to warrant credibility: man starts weirdly-named band, achieves minor fame, goes off the rails, goes to Africa and Mexico or something, uncovers a hitherto hidden part of his soul in the eyes of a little boy banging out clave on a dusty bucket, and returns home triumphant and ready to start another band, albeit this time with weird album names instead. If Levi-Strauss hadnâ€™t just died, he could have translated this guyâ€™s professional life into a work of structuralist anthropology called The Raw and the Half-Baked.\r\n\r\nBut Ampeater is, to quote the \"about us\" in the upper right hand corner, all about the music. Of course nothing really is all about anything. Still, if we stick to that optimistic assumption,Â <strong>Andy J Gallagher</strong>Â begins to look a lot better; great even. So OK, fuck history, letâ€™s get down to the tracks.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to pick two tracks for this 7-inch, not only because theyâ€™re all massively catchy, perfectly structured pop-punk tunes, but also because theyâ€™re all trying to do something different, referencing different pieces of the genreâ€™s canon, condensing whole decades worth of material into singular songs with proficiency and verve. I guess thatâ€™s a plug for the album. It is, for a person who always thought the Clash were better songwriters than the Beatles, and the Buzzcocks catchier than the Kinks, a heartwarming and self-affirming experience. If this is what homages sound like, I donâ€™t think the glory days ever really ended.\r\n\r\nSo, for the digital 7-inch, I think itâ€™s best to show this guyâ€™s range.Â <strong>A-side â€œFaster and Faster,â€</strong>Â takes a step backwards on the timeline, latching onto the death-and-sex sensibilities that fueled proto-punkâ€™s nihilistic self-presentation and coming up with something that could be a cover of an entire ideology.Â <strong>Gallagher</strong>Â makes no bones about the metaphysics of the sonic setup, saying itâ€™s,Â <em>â€œa song of 3 desperadoes - a pole dancer, a con and a junkie - who's lives are drifting away faster and faster. But, like in the movies, they all live happily ever after!â€</em>Â That two-note intro: Jesus Christ, itâ€™s horrifying, lurching like an emaciated gutter-kid wandering out of an alleyway covered in excrement and track marks or some massive British sealiner about to sink with thousands of people on board. This is music, I think, for the end of time, which, I suppose, the Thatcher years probably came alarmingly close to becoming. While Cold War dread has dissipated in the past twenty years, the resonances of this kind of aural cynicism still send shivers down my spine, not from excitement but from the lingering suspicion that radiation poisoning from billions of buried warheads crept into my fetal bloodstream way back in the beginning. Gallagher knows we're still living out a Reaganite nightmare, infected by weapons and experiments and mistakes from the past, slowly growing up into Fukuyamaâ€™s historyless zombies, looking for antiques to buy online and devour quietly in our bedrooms. Man, those werenâ€™t the glory days, but the End of Days. Happily ever after indeed.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œRope Swings Eternalâ€</strong>Â is more a historical commentary than a chilled-out diversion, embodying that late-70s sense that aggressive, sneering rock could maintain its abusive streak even while dressed up in crunchier clothes. The track sounds like a decadeâ€™s worth of stylistic transition, punk growing out of dive bars and basements to make music videos and expanding the textural palette of three chords played really fast into three chords played less fast and on an acoustic guitar.Â <em>â€œThere were a spate of angst ridden teenage suicides in the UK and this is a fictional take on that,â€</em>Â saysÂ <strong>Gallagher</strong>,<em>Â â€œThe song started with the title, a play on hope springs eternal, and was playing this Hawaiin sounding thing sliding up to the 12th fret and mucking around with the A shape, transposed it down to G and there's your verse.â€</em>Â But itâ€™s the more metaphorical kind of stylistic shape-shifting Gallagher captures here thatâ€™s important.Â <strong>â€œRope Swings Eternalâ€</strong>Â could essentially be thought of as a blown-up photograph of the punk genreâ€™s virus extending its epidemiology towards everything from folk to new wave to pop crossover, all the things that the scene, originally, never wanted to be. Spaced out, blissful, itâ€™s a killer track thatâ€™s timeless in the sense that it could only be made in semi-nostalgic retrospect. Historians say itâ€™s hard to write about contemporary events and figures with a critical eye. Gallagher, composing something like the Recorded History of Alternative Rock, seems to agree.",

		"content" : "If I learned anything as an Anthropology major in college, itâ€™s that when we speak ofÂ <em>\"human nature\"</em>Â weâ€™re almost always talking about culture. Countless ideas and institutions deemed natural for the human spirit are in fact part of a complex web of learned vocabulary. Take the Western notions of consonance and dissonance, the supporting base of musical tonality. It is in no way apparent a priori that certain tone combinations are pleasing while others are unrefined or disagreeable. Clearly, tonality is as much a constructed system as ethics, something which is produced by (not before) human interaction and disseminated, with constant re-adaptations, from generation to generation. An invocation of the musical philosophy of John Cage is appropriate here:Â <em>â€œThe first question I ask myself when something doesn't seem to be beautiful is why do I think it's not beautiful. And very shortly you discover that there is no reason.â€</em>Â This quote has always haunted me because I think it penetrates the problem of the question of music. What is and is not music, the obsession with exclusionary division, has marked every stage of Western musical history. Combining Cageâ€™s challenge of traditional aesthetic binaries (reflected in tonalityâ€™s consonance and dissonance) with the insights of anthropological thought, we see that the resolution of this historic problem is to nullify the binary by looking beyond our present cultural systems and imagining new systems awaiting to be forged. It shouldnâ€™t be as scary as it sounds. As Cage puts it,Â <em>â€œI can't understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I'm frightened of the old ones.â€</em>Â Doesnâ€™t the very health of our cultural spirit depend on an understanding of where we have been and where we can go? Are we to remain forever trapped in an outdated mode of thinking about sound? There are plenty of artists that understand this imperative, but the larger cultural landscape must recognize that sound is sound and must be reckoned with in any context.\r\n\r\nBrooklynâ€™sÂ <strong>Little Women</strong>Â understand the issues at stake here. The quartet, comprised ofÂ <strong>Darius Jones</strong>Â (alto saxophone),Â <strong>Jason Nazary</strong>Â (drums),Â <strong>Travis Laplante</strong>Â (tenor saxophone) andÂ <strong>Andrew Smiley</strong>Â (guitar) deal in sounds that present a real challenge to traditional notions of beauty and pleasure. It takes about 1 second of listening toÂ <strong>A-side â€œ[1] Untitledâ€</strong>Â from theÂ <strong>Teeth EP</strong>Â to hear what I mean. A waterfall of high-pitched shrapnel comes raining down without warning. The drummer sounds like a robotic octopus gone haywire. Itâ€™s not all sonic warfare here, however. About a minute in, some serious rhythmic unison interrupts the free-jazz tapestry being woven previously. Another minute goes by and suddenly the rhythm section has disappeared. Weâ€™re floating in a saxophone cloud assembled by Ornette Colemanâ€™s long-lost evil brother. A roaring punk section rips us out of that zone. Proving that \"out\" music doesnâ€™t necessarily mean pathological melody-aversion, the last few minutes of the song ride out on a pretty serious hum-dinger (well, before dissolving into another atonal freak-out at the end for good measure).\r\n\r\nAt this point, some of you faithful readers may be questioning my commitment to this Cagean Zen philosophy ofÂ <em>\"everything is beautiful.\"</em>Â After all, there are certainly some parts of the song we just listened to that would really stretch the essence of the word \"beautiful.\" Isnâ€™t the point rather that ugliness has its place in music alongside its glorified Other? Itâ€™s important to remind ourselves here of the precarious nature of cultural ideals with large amounts of stock. Our theories of musicality and aural pleasure are like an anesthetizing distraction from all the directions we artists and art consumers have to choose from. Who said music had to be beautiful all the time? Or is there even a transformation effect, where beauty becomes displeasing and the base reclaims the upper hand? Walter Benjamin prophesied that manâ€™s aesthetic telos was to find beauty in its own self-annihilation. The question then remains: Why canâ€™t there be a place for the grating, the deranged, the violent in our musical universe?\r\n\r\nAs a perfect example of the grating, the deranged and the violent in music, let us now turn toÂ <strong>Side-B â€œ[4] Untitledâ€</strong>Â from the same EP. The song starts off with a dissonant (gotcha!) foghorn which at one point inexplicably begins dueling with bagpipes (not actually). After a minute or so of this raw bleating, the main event begins. Someone fingers a saxophone almost inaudibly while the remaining band members whimper into microphones like scared children. This continues until these grown men (notÂ <strong>Little Women</strong>) are screaming like possessed lunatics. Then, they growl like animals and slowly die out. Itâ€™s sick, disturbing and incredibly powerful. I find the theatricality of this piece really interesting. Itâ€™s a forward-thinking composition that introduces new realms to me. If you find this stuff intolerable, I donâ€™t blame you. But before you write it off as \"unlistenable\" or whatever, think about the language youâ€™re using to describe these sounds. Think why youâ€™re turned off by it and what this has to do with your learning of a certain system of musical signs. Invoking Cage again,Â <em>â€œIf something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.â€</em>",

		"content" : "<em>â€œmujer terrorista, feminista, mexicana, americana, condenada, peligrosa... pistolera.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Pistolera</strong>, like many of the bands featured on The Ampeater Review, hails from Brooklyn but their heart lies over the border. And no, Iâ€™m not talking about Queens. The quartet, which featuresÂ <strong>Sandra Velasquez</strong>Â (vocals, guitar),Â <strong>Ani Cordero</strong>Â (drums),Â <strong>Inca B. Satz</strong>Â (bass), andÂ <strong>Maria Elena</strong>Â (accordion), plays an energetic blend of ranchera, cumbia, and rock. Â Velasquezâ€™s percussive guitar and Satzâ€™s reggae-tinged bass grooves lines would be standard enough fare in Brooklynâ€™s dives, but Elenaâ€™s peppy accordion-driven melodies and Corderoâ€™s distinctly Latin percussion, not to mention lyrics entirely in Spanish, evoke the small-town cantina mexicana.\r\n\r\nThe first time I sawÂ <strong>Pistolera</strong>Â perform was at AS220 in Providence, RI in the winter of 2006, before a small but enthusiastic crowd. The band was less than a year old and didnâ€™t yet have an album under their belt. Nevertheless, they were overflowing with energy and managed to bring a crowd of skeptical hipsters to their feet. My knowledge of Spanish, still far from perfect, was then rudimentary at best, so I wasnâ€™t paying much attention to the lyrics. I was just having a blast. The groove was unstoppable. During extended breakdowns the whole band would take shifts on cowbell or clapping out complex clave rhythms. I picked up a copy of their self titled EP and have been tracking them ever since.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years,Â <strong>Pistolera</strong>Â has come along way. The world is finally beginning to take note of this underappreciated band. In addition to gigging across the United States, they recently performed at the Montreal Jazz Festival and have toured in Europe and Mexico. Theyâ€™ve shared the stage with many prolific acts including Lila Downs, Los Lobos, and Vieux Farka TourÃ©. I suppose that Lila Downs and Los Lobos are logical enough pairings since both play music not unlike Pistoleraâ€™s, albeit Downs with a more prominent jazz influence and Los Lobos leaning more toward rock. But what about Malian singer and guitarist TourÃ©? Frankly, I think Pistolera could be a hit in almost any niche. Luckily they donâ€™t try to pigeonhole themselves.\r\n\r\n<strong>Pistolera</strong>Â has recently recorded two full length LPs. Their debutÂ <strong>Siempre Hay Salida</strong>Â (Thereâ€™s Always a Way Out) was released in 2006 and followed up byÂ <strong>En Este Camino</strong>Â (On This Road) in 2008. Both albums were produced by Grammy award-winning producer Charlie Dos Santos and sound top notch, with additional instrumentation pushing the bandâ€™s already festive sound to new levels.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, the first time I heardÂ <strong>Pistolera</strong>Â I didnâ€™t catch the lyrics but since then Iâ€™ve given them a lot of thought. The name Pistolera is Spanish for female gunslinger andÂ <strong>Sanrda Velasquez</strong>, who writes most of the bandâ€™s material, is a true pistolera. Donâ€™t be fooled by the peppy rhythms and joyous melodiesâ€¦ she means business. The music is deceptively lighthearted and the lyrics pack a strong political punch. Her socially conscious songs address issues such as immigrantsâ€™ rights, war, racism, feminism, and life on the border.\r\n\r\nThese arenâ€™t songs of rebellion in a vague or disjointed sense. These are struggles that the Mexican-American women ofÂ <strong>Pistolera</strong>Â have a strong personal connection to. And so, we return to the epigraph,Â <em>â€œmujer terrorista, feminista, mexicana, americana, condenada, peligrosa... pistolera!â€</em>Â which is incidentally the final line ofÂ <strong>A-side \"PolicÃ­a\"</strong>Â (Police). The words lose a lot of their elegance in English, but hereâ€™s a rough translation:<em>Â â€œterrorist woman, feminist, Mexican, American, condemned, dangerous, PISTOLERA.â€</em>Â Few phrases could better describeÂ <strong>Velasquez</strong>. Edgy and autobiographical, in \"PolicÃ­a\" she attacks the xenophobic and racist police whoâ€™ve unfairly targeted her.\r\n\r\n<em>Me tratan como un criminal, como una traicionera.\r\nMujer terrorista, peligrosa pistolera.\r\nSeÃ±or policÃ­a, hay una explicaciÃ³n.\r\nNo es lo que piensa es que soy mÃºsico.\r\nLas balas que encontrÃ³ guardadas en mi estuche, no seran usadas pa' echar tiros a nadie.\r\nSeÃ±or policÃ­a, le digo la verdad.\r\nSi soy peligrosa pero no con las armas.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>They treat me like a criminal, like a traitor.\r\nTerrorist woman, dangerous pistolera.\r\nMr. Policie officer there is an explanation.\r\nIt is not what you think, itâ€™s that I am a musician.\r\nThe bullets that you found inside my suitcase will not be used to shoot anyone.\r\nMr Police officer I am telling you the truth.\r\nI am dangerous, but not with guns.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>\"PolicÃ­a\"</strong>Â has become somewhat of an anthem for the band.Â <strong>Velasquez</strong>Â explains,Â <em>â€œ[it] is a crowd favorite at shows. It's why we decided to make it our first music video for En Este Caminoâ€</em>Â (see the videoÂ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QXd-4eZelI\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).\r\n\r\nLike the lyrics, the video chronicles a hostile encounter betweenÂ <strong>PistoleraÂ </strong>and the police. The band shows up to a gig but a security guard (who looks suspiciously like a Federal Agent) refuses to let them through the door. The scene could be viewed as an extended metaphor, the band turned away at the door like immigrants turned away at the border. In typical Pistolera fashion, while the lyrics are provocative, the music is free and happy. A strong ranchero rhythm and persistent cowbell keep the pulse going. The music video captures this contrast well. Spliced with shots of the band being stopped by guards are shots of them on stage inside the club, playing their hearts out before a dancing crowd. In this case, thereâ€™s a happy ending. The guard is pulled inside the club and as his sunglasses and tie are stripped away, he begins to feel the rhythm and dances along. If only it were that simple.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"Un Momento\"</strong>Â (One Moment) is not a typicalÂ <strong>Pistolera</strong>Â song. In fact, VelasquezÂ explains that she included it on this digital 7-inch precisely because itâ€™s so different from most of Pistoleraâ€™s material.Â <em>\"A true B-side, it shows another side of the band.\"Â </em>The recording is heavily orchestrated. A tuba grunts along with the bass line and a clarinet noodles playfully between vocal lines. Throw in accented downbeats with snare hits on the two and four, and youâ€™ve got something reminiscent of Louis Armstrong or Bix Beiderbecke. But the minor tonality andÂ <strong>Elenaâ€™s</strong>Â somber accordion melody completely recontextualize whateverâ€™s been evoked. Both peppy and mournful, if \"Un Momento\" is one thing, itâ€™s determined. Itâ€™s as if the band is telling us to march on in spite of whatever hardships lie in this path, en este camino.\r\n\r\nThe lyrics deal with loss although exactly who or what is lost is slightly ambiguous. A lover, friend, a mentor, a parent, a homeland, a part of herselfâ€¦theyâ€™re cryptic and poetic and beautiful.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œSiempre me dijiste que algun dia tendrias que irte.\r\nNo te queria creer aunque nunca me mentiste.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<em>â€œYou always told me that you would have to go one day.\r\nI didnâ€™t want to believe you, even though you had never lied before.â€</em>\r\n\r\nSo whatâ€™s up next forÂ <strong>Pistolera</strong>? Currently theyâ€™re taking some time off from touring to work on not one but two albums, to be released in 2010. One will be a normal Pistolera album, the other will be a kidâ€™s album. WAIT, backupâ€¦. a kidsâ€™ album? On theirÂ <a href=\"http://www.pistolera.net\">website</a>Â the band explains,Â <em>\"the three women of Pistolera are all mothers, and this project could not have been born without the knowledge and experience that comes with being a parent. We are really excited and look forward to giving our younger audiences something they can easily sing along to in English and Spanish!\"</em>Â There are plenty of parents who play Mozart for their children, but for those of us who want to raise bilingual kids, perhaps this is a bit more pragmatic. All I ask is that nobody gives me a hard time if I want to sing along at 23.",

		"content" : "<strong>In Ampeater's words:\r\n</strong>I liked Legato Vipers from the first listen, but didn't know what to make of the band's psychadellic cinematic surf-rock antics. The music was quirky, groovy, and, without a doubt, over the top. But were these dudes for real, or was it all an elaborate and well executed joke? I've come to the conclusion that its a little of both.\r\n\r\nI was in a lot of bands in high-schoolâ€”more than I can count on two hands. These bands spanned an enormous range of styles but involved the same general cast of characters, despite abrupt shifts in image and wardrobe. One week it would be death metal, the next, gospel pop, nautical ballads, etc. We were too aware of the cliches to make serious bands so, we called them fake bands. Semantics, perhaps, but these fake bands gave us the freedom to be extreme, to be absurd, to have fun. In the end, these fake bands became a lot more real than the serious ones. I've spoken to several friends since then and discovered that a large number of serious musicians have turned to joke bands as creative outlets.\r\n\r\nBut Legato Vipers is much more than a joke band, although it does seem to stem from the same philosophy. With superlative musicianship and top-notch production, the band has elevated an absurd concept into something legitimate. Perhaps a better metaphor would be performance art. Legato Vipers, like most theater, cannot be appreciated without considerable suspension of disbelief. After all, it's surf-rock... in 2013... from Canada. But the band makes this leap of faith so convincingly that it's hard not to follow. From the mysterious and spacy tremolo guitar to the propulsive drum and bass, everything is spot-on. It's said that the best actors don't have to actâ€”from the moment they take the stage, they become their characters. When I watch Legato Vipers rock out in an empty stadium in the center of a swarm of roller-skaters, that's the impression I get. Each member plays his role with precision and a passion that seems too much to fake. Perhaps they're having a laugh, but they're also having a blast, and I suspect that they believe 100% in what they're doing. We should too. Tune in and enjoy the show.\r\n\r\n<strong>In the artist's words:\r\n</strong>Common Grackle was the beginning of Legato Vipers. When â€œThe Great Repressionâ€ took a booze-fueled, bastardized-surf turn for the worse at Camp Pepper, something happened in the mind of Belluz that can only be described as inspired stupidity. Brooks had indeed learned to do reverb-soaked tremolos!\r\n\r\nTheir take on the genre made an appearance on Del Belâ€™s â€œOneiric.â€ Better or worse, this thing was gathering steamâ€¦\r\n\r\nBut it was in a remote barn on Bruce Peninsula that Jamesonâ€™s was chased with warm beer; the â€œChocolate Milkâ€ aftertaste was coined. A theme song followed. So did three Belluz shit-surf originals for an as-yet nameless band.\r\n\r\nPyle agreed to rerecord an EP. Howard, Johnson and Anderson too were added. Brooks wrote four more tracks-- fit for a funeral home. The band met in one to play and track their first-ever note. â€œLegato Vipersâ€ were christened.\r\n\r\n<strong>Upcoming events:\r\n</strong><a href=\"http://exclaim.ca/Upcoming/ConcertListings/grickle_grass_festival-london-2013-05-25\" target=\"_blank\">Grickle Grass Festival</a>Â -Â May 25thÂ - London\r\n<a href=\"http://nxne.com/artists\" target=\"_blank\">NxNE</a>Â -Â June 12thÂ - Toronto\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hillsidefestival.ca/pages/performers/legato-vipers\" target=\"_blank\">Hillside Festival</a>Â -Â July 26thÂ - Guelph\r\n<a href=\"http://mudtownrecords.com/mudtown-music-arts-festival/\" target=\"_blank\">Mudtown Music &amp; Arts Festival</a>Â -Â Aug 10thÂ - Owen Sound",

		"content" : "<strong>Verb the Adjective Noun</strong>Â like crescendos. Listening to their EPs (available for free at the adorably namedÂ <a href=\"http://www.welikeyoualot.com\">www.welikeyoualot.com</a>) brought to mind my first time hearing fellow folk-rock screamers Okkervil River. Each song (with the exception of AmpeaterÂ <strong>A-side â€œMadelineâ€</strong>Â which is a born power-pop single if I've ever heard one) begins with something nondescript: a few simple strummed chords or a gentle fingerpicking riff. The verse melodies tend to be pleasant but not aggressive. They flow by easily at first, usually taking a detour through a catchy, relaxed instrumental interlude and then somehow, by the end of each track, somersaulting into an absolutely cathartic explosion, carried by the worn out, raw vocals: usually a creaky baritone doubled in octaves by an expressive, quavery second voice (actually at the climaxes Verb the Adjective Noun tend to just f*ckin' go for it and overdub about 100 vocal tracks, but these two are the most prominent; check out the chorus of â€œMadelineâ€ for an example). The effect calls to mind another Boston native who specializes in weaving the simplest melodies and harmonies into gold, Tim Howard of Soltero.\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering why I haven't identified these vocalists or even songwriters by name. Well, the thing is, the band has such a cheery community persona that you'd probably have to trek out to LA and see them live to even find out who's singing each song (the singers have seriously distinctive voices but I have no idea which band members they are). When I contacted them to ask about an Ampeater single my extremely friendly, exclamation-happy correspondent neglected to even sign the emails with anything but â€œVerbâ€. I guess it's possible that they answer emails collectively (the image of five dudes clustered around a laptop arguing about whether to close the email withÂ <em>â€œradical!â€</em>Â orÂ <em>â€œawesome!â€</em>Â is almost irresistible), but really what this means is that this is aÂ <em>band</em>, not some collection of dudes biding their time before they can launch their own solo projects. This spirit is crucial to any band that has multiple songwriters. There's always the danger in such situations that the personalities of the frontmen can diverge so violently that it's like listening to two different bands, but Verb puts up a consistently unified front. If the seams are there, they've been spackled over with precision, and the resulting music has that perfect band chemistry that manages to bring out the strengths of each member and keep any indulgences in check.\r\n\r\n<strong>Verb the Adjective Noun</strong>Â formed in early 2008 as a trio composed of songwritersÂ <strong>Shay Spence,</strong>Â <strong>Alexander Krispin</strong>, andÂ <strong>Luc Laurent</strong>, and recorded their debut EPÂ <strong>Novella</strong>Â in a church in the summer of 2008. They followed it up in December withÂ <strong>Reds</strong>, from which these two songs are culled, addingÂ <strong>Wayne Whittaker</strong>Â andÂ <strong>James Bookert</strong>Â to the live band to fill out the incredibly expansive sound of tracks likeÂ <strong>â€œMadelineâ€</strong>Â with its tolling bells and booming drums. The enormity of the drum sound on this track cannot be overstated. It sounds like the drums on The Soft Bulletin, like someone beating on planets with columns of fire.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above,Â <strong>â€œMadelineâ€</strong>Â has has all the marks of a song that magically descended from above and poured out of some lucky dude's guitar perfectly intact, like Athena leaping out of Zeus's head. You can always tell when you hear these songs. They're the kind that come into existence effortlessly, and you know that when the songwriter finished them and sat back for a second, he thoughtÂ <em>â€œwhoa, what just happened?â€</em>Â Like all great pop songs, it has that mysterious whole that is so much more than the sum of its melodic and harmonic parts, which, as perÂ <strong>Verb the Adjective Noun's</strong>Â mission statement, are allÂ <em>â€œsimplicity and raw energy.â€</em>Â The chorus itself is just pure, gooey, pop joy, but the more you listen to the song the more you begin to see how everything else is perfectly placed: the bell sounds during the breaks that just crack the song wide open, the switch of the chorus drum feel right at the word â€œMadelineâ€, the breakdown and huge crescendo just when you thought the song was over (an old trick, but there's a reason it's still around: it works), the shivery, tense guitar solo that manages to be just totally naturally weird (like, Jeff Tweedy on painkillers weird) without disturbing the essential pop core of the song. Another layer leaps out with every listen.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œOh! Catastrophe,â€</strong>Â despite its trendily placed exclamation point, brings the folk rock origins of the band more to the fore. The lyrics concern what seems to be a nastily failed relationship that culminates in the narrator burning down his apartment (<em>take my everything / leave me smoldering</em>). It hinges on that semi-secret relationship between disaster and freedom, in which a certain joyful liberation comes from losing everything you have in a traumatic and sudden way. The music is slow build set to a loping 6/8, filled out by a shimmering organ and what sounds like a vibraphone, both metallic, light sounds that seem to mirror the lyrical fire. The vocals pull back hard on the time, shivering with emotion at the ends of lines, and building up through an organ led instrumental break and into the big catharsis of the last chorus, where the song leaps to the minor four, always a good move for a climax, and the vocals howlÂ <em>â€œdo your worst to meâ€</em>Â over and over with an energy that could be either despair or elation. It's way too risky to be cool, and there's something to be said for that.\r\n\r\n<strong>Verb the Adjective Noun</strong>Â is still a young band, and you can be sure that their sound is still developing, pushing against the energy boundaries of acoustic instruments (the volume difference between the two EPs is dramatic) and perhaps towards the sound laid out in power pop tracks likeÂ <strong>â€œMadeline.â€</strong>Â Still, no matter what direction they head in, you can be sure that the richly beating hearts behind their dynamic early work will keep simplicity, energy and warm, breathing humanity at the core of their songs.",

		"content" : "My friend and musical companion Jeremy once gave me this advice when I told him I was having trouble writing songs:Â <em>â€œStart with a philosophical concept and try to make the sound describe that concept.â€</em>Â It was an interesting, if startling method that I had never encountered before. Should music proceed from some base of an idea and build from there? Or do what we call â€œphilosophical conceptsâ€ even have a place in music? Donâ€™t we still put stock in the transcendence of the musical experience, in its absence of direct reference and metaphor? Only in a very restricted sense. As many worthwhile contemporary artists have proven, idea and form are mutually illuminating projects. One does not follow the other. They contain and advance each other.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the question of poetry. I mention poetry because it is so fine an example of how music is more complicated than we give it credit for when we examine it through a philosophical lens. How to delineate the spaces of music and language? How can we think of music as autonomous fromÂ <em>â€œeveryday experienceâ€</em>Â when its very essence is inscribed by Being, the most important entity in Heideggerian (and other influential) philosophy.Â <strong>Stuart Watson</strong>, who records underÂ <strong>Order or Ardor</strong>, shows us how these issues must be met head on in music. His songs are the familiar imbued with a spiritual intensity that emits an inspiring radiance. Not only does Order or Ardor deal withÂ <em>â€œpure sound,â€</em>Â it deals with pure feeling, pure being and the dynamic play between those forces in carefully constructed auditory space. Watson is a towering intellect, so it comes as no surprise that his music deftly handles weighty themes while still remaining fun in sound.\r\n\r\nWrites the man himself:Â <em>â€œThe band's name is meant to evoke the Apollonian/Dionysian split described by Nietzsche in 'The Birth of Tragedy'. In this project I am attempting to harness both intensity of feeling and clarity of composition; I want there to be a dynamic, almost dialectical tension between the elements in the songs themselves. In certain instances, generally my more experimental pieces, ardor wins out over order, as it were, but in other cases, ecstatic energies are reined in and dominated by the \"songness\" of a piece--passion in the service of reason, order over ardor.</em>\r\n\r\n<em></em><em>â€œMusically I draw on Neil Young as a kind of ethical center, while Johnny Cash and Ian Curtis have had the most direct influence on my singing. I have a background in jazz guitar and bass, and that in some measure informs the kinds of songs I write. Among contemporary artists I have the highest respect for Larkin Grimm, Woods, Dirty Projectors, and Animal Collective; these people are making music that inspires me on a daily basis. Philosophy and poetry inform my writing on account of my day gig as an adjunct professor and English PhD student, but I try to keep my songs as direct as possible lyrically. Simplicity of expression is something I value, as are emotional openness and honesty, and I try to make music that reflects that. I am a believer in the visionary and transforming power of love. I am also an adherent to rationality. These two elements come into conflict, hence the band name. These songs were recorded by me in my studio, Deep Dark Carlos. \"Borderlands\" is a meditation on change, on transformation, on traveling through liminal spaces. \"How I Am Blind\" is a coming to terms with failed love. Both songs represent a version of the balance of order and ardor in my life.â€</em>\r\n\r\nOnÂ <strong>A-side â€œBorderlands,â€</strong>Â the self-ascribed Ian Curtis influence rings true, but as with other bands who draw inspiration from the Joy Division frontman (Interpol comes to mind),Â <strong>Order or Ardor</strong>Â has something deeper below the surface. The synth textures call to mind the grooves of Brian Enoâ€™s otherworldly masterpiece, Another Green World. There are also hints of the restless post-punk experimentalism of Xiu Xiu. The drum machine has that crisp analogue sound of New Order and other similar 80s New Wave bands (it is in fact the same drum machine used by New Order). One shouldnâ€™t take this as an act of gearheadism. Rather, this points to one of the more distinguishing features of Order or Ardorâ€™s musicâ€”that is, the sound space in itself.Â <strong>Watson</strong>Â happens to be an expert producer (full disclosure: Heâ€™s engineering and producingÂ <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem001\" target=\"_blank\">my new album</a>) with an uncanny ear for mix, richness and instrumental clarity. Itâ€™s a rare thing to have a musician with battling talents in songwriting and production, although I suppose in the age of laptop studios itâ€™s becoming increasingly common. But this is more than just some slapdash home recording experiment. Itâ€™s the continuation of a method made possible by home studio heads like This Heat andÂ <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem028\" target=\"_blank\">Phil Elverum</a>. In other words, having New Orderâ€™s drum machine in your studio, if youâ€™re not a jive fool, means incorporating a texture that has great meaning for you after years of listening. By entering that sound into the mix, Watson is participating actively in music history, recycling and readapting sounds to create new combinations. This is how music goes forward (I hesitate to use the word â€œprogressesâ€) and creates a somewhat coherent narrative instead of little style islands, episodic flashes in a vacuum\r\n\r\nBut letâ€™s not get bogged down in historical musicology. ThoughÂ <strong>Order or Ardor</strong>Â certainly provides a platform for waxing philosophic (like all good music), itâ€™s also about enjoyment. TakeÂ <strong>B-side â€œHow I am Blindâ€</strong>Â which places us into poppier territory than doesÂ <strong>â€œBorderlands.â€</strong>Â An Aphex Twin-reminiscent drumbeat and humming synthesizer provide the perfect background forÂ <strong>Watsonâ€™s</strong>Â pleasantly simple guitar progression. However, the brighter the pop song, they say, the darker its demons. â€œI showed how I am blindâ€ intones Watson, simultaneously deadpan and crushingly emotive. Sad dance!\r\n\r\nUltimately, if these songs prove anything, itâ€™s the overwhelming and inescapable presence of feeling in music. Scoff if you will at the idea of philosophy in music, but both derive from two important sources: Being and Feeling.",

		"content" : "<em>â€œI've always considered myself primarily a songwriterâ€</em>Â saysÂ <strong>Pete Galub</strong>, who also sings and plays guitar. For nearly two decades Galub has been a force in New Yorkâ€™s vast underground music scene. He started gigging at the tender age of 15, performing in CBGBâ€™s and other NYC clubs. Over the years heâ€™s played in numerous bands and shared the stage with Gillian Welch and Liz Phair among others. But as he insists, Galub is a songwriter above all else. He cites a diverse range of musical influences from the likes of Thelonius Monk to 60s and 80s melodic guitar pop music a la the Byrds, Big Star, and the Chills, as well as folk/country tunesmiths like the Louvin Brothers and Michael Hurley, and raw punk groups like Wire and the Undertones. Decades of experience and an eclectic taste in music have certainly made their mark on his songwriting, which embraces both the catchy and the quirky. As he puts it,Â <em>â€œI love catchy melodies and great songs. I love dissonance. I love experimentation and growth and try to integrate improvisation, noise, and other things into live performances of the pop songs I write. Sometimes they're an absolute train wreck, sometimes they're the most gratifying moments of my life.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Galubâ€™s</strong>Â most recent projectÂ <strong>Pete Galub &amp; The Annuals</strong>Â is a three piece rock band. Admittedly, rock is a fairly generic term. Pete Galub &amp; The Annuals are anything but generic, but itâ€™s the only term broad enough to encompass their unique blend of power pop, punk, blues, and country. In addition to Galub (guitar, lead vocals) the trio feature featuresÂ <strong>Tom Gavin</strong>Â (bass, vocals) andÂ <strong>Chris Moore</strong>Â (drums, vocals). Like Galub, both are prolific songwriters and seasoned veterans whoâ€™ve been performing for years. The result is a band with superb chemistry and a superior sense of song. One critic describes it asÂ <em>\"Lou Reed meets Leonard Cohen meets Neil Young\"</em>Â and thatâ€™s not a bad comparison because like Reed, Cohen, or Young, Pete Galub &amp; The Annuals play well crafted songs that could have been written forty years ago or yesterday or twenty years from now. They have an appeal that transcends trendy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Galubâ€™s</strong>Â latest album,Â <strong>Boy Gone Wrong</strong>, released in 2003 and featuring The Annuals on most tracks, is nothing short of a subtle masterpieceâ€”subtle because it lack bells and whistles and, if listened to inattentively, might seem straightforward, even bland, but give it a closer listen and youâ€™ll be hooked. From \"Hidden Crumbs,\" the mellow country-inflected first track, through \"Serving Spoon,\" the energetic and slightly bitter final cut, the album has impeccable flow. The lyrics are captivating and the songwriting is in a league of its own, each track arranged with deceptive intricacy. Critic Geraint Jones puts it well when he asserts thatÂ <em>â€œGalubâ€™s songs could just as easily be described as bleakly harrowing as they could blackly humorous, depending on your interpretation.\"</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Galub</strong>Â is currently at work on a new album,Â <strong>Weird Space</strong>, which is due out in early 2010. Although Weird Space is technically a solo release, it features The Annuals heavily and Galub considers the band vibe to be prominent on the album. This is certainly true ofÂ <strong>A-side \"Reacquaintance,\"</strong>Â an energetic rock song which features bothÂ <strong>Moore</strong>Â andÂ <strong>Gavin</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Reacquaintance\"</strong>Â is only a three chord song but it doesnâ€™t sound so simple thanks to<strong>Â Galubâ€™sÂ </strong>unconventional voicings and brilliant arranging job. The recording begins with a richly swept guitar but during the verses Galub steps back and letsÂ <strong>Gavinâ€™s</strong>Â hypnotic bass line anchor it down.Â <strong>Mooreâ€™s</strong>Â choice to lay off the cymbals, along with Galubâ€™s palm muted guitar, create suspense during the chorus and help to distinguish it from the verse. The falsetto vocal line at the end of the chorus provides a nice hook while Galubâ€™s guitar solo is another interesting touch, starting off bluely but quickly devolving into a noisy mess. The lyrics are a little hard to make out over the ruckus but, as with all of Galubâ€™s lyrics, theyâ€™re worth a close listen. The imagery is fresh. Galub never says exactly what youâ€™d expect him to say, but instead opts for unconventional but evocative metaphors.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œFor 500 midnights, I wore your clothes\r\nReferring to people nobody knows\r\nTheir green eyes grasping for some kind of feeling\r\nLike amputee spiders stuck on the ceilingâ€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Reacquaintance\"</strong>Â ends on a strange noteâ€”literallyâ€”after the final chorus the band escalates to a fourth chord (oh my!) and completely falls apart. A fitting conclusion given the lyrics that precede it,Â <em>â€œI have to go, my ride is waitingâ€¦ Alone.â€</em>Â And indeed, each member of the band wanders off in his own directionâ€¦ alone.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Reacquaintance\"</strong>Â is fairly indicative ofÂ <strong>Galubâ€™s</strong>Â recent work. Not true ofÂ <strong>B-side \"Ransom\"</strong>Â which is the only track onÂ <strong>Boy Gone Wrong</strong>Â without bass and drums. Galub explainsÂ <em>â€œit's a totally different vibe and I always liked that aspect of singles. Â It shows (hopefully) another side of my writing, that's a little more introspective and intimate.â€</em>Â Indeed it does, and itâ€™s probably my favorite cut off of the album. Itâ€™s one thing to make a song shine with a band behind it, but to pull off such a sparse arrangement is an absolutely remarkable achievement. This song is so good that it doesnâ€™t need a band. The stripped down mix exposes it in unadulterated glory. Vocals are at the front of the mix, accompanied throughout most of the recording only by a softly strummed acoustic guitar. A few soft electronics creep in, but they just add a bit of color.\r\n\r\n<strong>Galubâ€™s</strong>Â voice isnâ€™t exactly beautiful but itâ€™s saturated with intensity. Those high notes push the limit of his range but his obvious struggle to reach them compliments the sense of desperation pervasive throughout the song. The lyrics are delightfully morbid.Â <em>â€œI was the blood on the fan blade when your hands got too curiousâ€¦â€</em>Â Galubâ€™s mock operatic falsetto onÂ <em>â€œEvery time you killed meâ€</em>Â remind me of Jeff Buckley but with slightly more sarcasm. Curtis Ellerâ€™s absolutely dirty harmonica solo seems like a nod to Bob Dylan or, rather, like Dylan thrown into a rusty cuisinart and diced to oblivion. Ellerâ€™s screeching notes, drenched in feedback, bend in and out of tune. The solo drives the song several notches higher in intensity and when Galub finally returns on vocals, heâ€™s practically shouting.\r\n\r\nFor such a gifted songwriter,Â <strong>Galubâ€™s</strong>Â remarkably modest. When asked about his goals for the band in a recent interview, he replied,Â <em>â€œto quote Spinal Tap -'no page in history baby that I don't need/ I just wanna make some eardrums bleed.'\"</em>",

		"content" : "There's a line in aÂ <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem002\">Boy Without God</a>Â song that goesÂ <em>\"And if you play an instrument, I'm probably a little bit in love with you.\"</em>Â I'm not sure whether there's some sort of chip that they put in pubescent males when we're not looking, but it's almost universally accepted as fact by most young men of quality and standing that if you can play three chords on your older brother's beat up acoustic, we like you. A lot. The best performers have a way of creating a bridge between stage and audience that makes every listener in the room think that he or she (and only he or she) is being sung to, and that each song was written explicity for his or her ears. This is the pinnacle of the coffeehouse experience, and it's something that generally only transpires in documentaries about Greenwich Village in the 60s. And yet, I get the same feeling whenÂ <strong>Lady Lamb the Beekeeper</strong>Â pops up on iTunes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lady Lamb the Beekeeper (Aly Spaltro)</strong>Â is one of those rare individuals for whom musical expression is so natural, so inherently part of her being, that she's able to produce truly moving art with a grace seldom seen at her age (or any age, for that matter). When her plans to travel to Guatamala between high school and college fell through and she was suddenly faced with a year of aimlessness,Â <strong>Spaltro</strong>Â made a conscious decision to begin making music. Under most normal circumstances, this seems like a logical step, but I neglected to mention that prior to making this decision Spaltro had no musical experience. So, she began to assemble her arsenal, beginning not with instruments, but with the means by which to capture her (at this point imaginary) songs--an 8 track tape recorder. That's right, she bought the recording equipmentÂ <em>first</em>. Now that's commitment.\r\n\r\nBut she had a clear and simple concept in mind: she wanted to layer instruments, to create songs with an emphasis on sonic texture. When most musicians say something like this, their music ends up sounding like an Animal Collective b-side, or some equally soupy collage of overlapping samples, but not so withÂ <strong>Spaltro</strong>. Her songs have their origins in folk music and the more delicate side of modern indie pop. A certain innocence pervades them that's maybe better described as conviction--there's no sense that she's \"trying\" to accomplish anything in particular, but rather creating exactly the songs that she needs to create in exactly the way that she needs to create them. There's little to no artistic pretension in her music, just a quarter-inch cable from her brain to your stereo.\r\n\r\n<strong>Spaltro</strong>Â immediately dove into her newfound passion, recording two solo demos in two months while simultaneously learning each instrument needed to tranfer her mental soundscape to tape. Heads up, this next part sounds a bit like the beginning of some rock and roll fairy tale (and let's hope it is). She left 9 copies of her demo in a brown paper case on the counter of Bull Moose music in Brunswick, ME. 8 of these disappeared, their captors absconding into the ether never to be heard from again; 1 went to TJ Metcalfe, who teamed up with Spaltro and became Lady Lamb the Beekeeper's all-purpose instrumental accompaniment. Together they recorded a number of new tracks, and culling the best of Spaltro's early demos, a third album came into being:Â <strong>For Handsome Animals</strong>. Now available in a paper case at a record store near you! Or, you know,Â on iTunes.\r\n\r\nThe two songs onÂ <strong>Lady Lamb the Beekeper's</strong>Â Ampeater 7-inch straddle the full length of her budding career.Â <strong>Side A \"Almond Colored Sheets\"</strong>Â is her most recently recorded track, scheduled to see a limited CD release on an upcoming album of demos and rarities. Built on the trifecta of banjo, organ, and vocals,Â <strong>\"Almond Colored Sheets\"</strong>Â is nothing short of spectacular. I chalked up a double digit play count within an hour of this tune hitting my inbox. It opens with the poignantly redemptive,Â <em>\"I was running through a bad dream, but now I can make it out,\"Â </em>which situates the tune in whatever emotional state wavers between lucid dreaming, childhood nostalgia, and genuine longing. It's as though Spaltro cast a net and captured those little thoughts that dart in and out of your head when you space out on long bus rides.\r\n\r\nThis tune has all the hooks, well, all the good ones anyways. The banjo provides a solid percussive base while the organ serves up a soothing harmonic drone and some brilliantly placed melodic figures. This foundation freesÂ <strong>Spaltro's</strong>Â voice to be optimally expressive as the song builds towards an inevitable climax. I like to think of Spaltro as a musical sponge, absorbing sounds for the first eighteen years of her life, just knowing that when she reached the appropriate saturation point she'd put all that stored knowledge to good use. She doesn't disappoint. At about 2:24 in, there's a dramatic break in the instrumentation as she finishes the verse,Â <em>\"I slipped out of the shower to discover that his mother had taken my towel, so I had to resort to using your old kindergarten t-shirt.\"</em>Â If hearing Spaltro sing the wordsÂ <em>\"your old kindergarten t-shirt</em>\" doesn't instantly recall some long lost flake of memory, please seek medical attention, as you're officially immune to music.\r\n\r\n<strong>Side B \"Dinosaur Song\"</strong>Â is one ofÂ <strong>Spaltro'sÂ </strong>first complete recordings, completed during a time in which she was eager to put her thoughts down on tape even as she was still learning the rudiments of each instrument. The whole tune was written and recorded in less than an hour, and each part was completed in one take. Maybe it's just Christmas breathing down my neck, but with its haunting vocal opening and sparse guitar, I feel likeÂ <strong>\"Dinosaur Song\"</strong>Â could be a bonus track on the Edward Scissorhands soundtrack. Like Jeff Mangum's recordings as Neutral Milk Hotel, Lady Lamb the Beekeeper's songs are miniature worlds in and of themselves; to listen is to step inside something truly special, so take your coat off and stay a while. She sings,\r\n\r\n<em>I want to fly my soul like a kite,\r\nwant to see you walk through that doorway\r\nand into this room where i am waiting for you\r\nyou like the sea\r\nand how the sea began with a drop of sweat\r\nsoaked into a cloud swiped across the brow of god\r\nand how he rung it out into sharp teeth to scales\r\nand how the carnivore was born</em>\r\n\r\nListening to this song is like reading Catullus's love poems in alternating lines with Bullfinch's Mythology--I'm not sure whether I'm hearing love poetry or legend, but either way I like it. The recording can get a bit rough at points, but there's greatness here. If those 8 mystery owners of the original demo had really listened to the music, if they'd fully stepped into the world ofÂ <strong>Lady Lamb the Beekeeper,</strong>Â they'd have kept the disc in a safe deposit box--who knows, it might pay for their retirement some day.\r\n\r\nOK, maybe that's a little hyperbolic, but there are big things on the horizon forÂ <strong>Lady Lamb the Beekeper</strong>. On the heels of her Maine \"world\" tour (she hit only towns in her home state that share names with countries) this past summer, she began working with producer Alias to create something with a bit more sheen than her self-recorded demos. Truth be told, Spaltro could sing into a transister radio and I'd still buy the record. Having said that, I can't wait to see her bust out a full band studio album--wonderful, magical things will happen. When I hear these songs, I hear St. Vincent, Karen O, and Feist; but somehow I get the feeling that the day is fast approaching when St. Vincent, Karen O, and Feist will get to hear Lady Lamb the Beekeeper.",

		"content" : "We tend to think of sad, acoustic guitar anchored music as being intimate (I don't want to call it 'folk' because folk is already another kind of music. You know, like The Carter Family singing â€œJohn Hardyâ€). It's a music of deeply personal songs whispered in bedrooms and as such it has the effect of feeling like a direct communication between us and a softly crooning bearded guy. It's a kind of music that can really only exist perfectly on record, as softly crooning into a microphone in front of 600 people all craning their necks to get a glimpse of the artist's sensible clothing doesn't have quite the same effect. Recently, though, there seems to have emerged an interest in taking the small, cramped spaces of confessional music and cracking them wide open without sacrificing the personal content and directness that made the original style so appealing.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ampeatermusic.com/aem028\">Phil Elverum's</a>Â songs as The Microphones and Mt. Eerie are so lyrically intimate they can sometimes feel like reading an intercepted letter. It's almost uncomfortable. Yet while the songs have their moments of expected musical smallness, of hushed words and strummed guitar, Elverum often chooses to mirror the emotional content of the lyrics (often represented with nature imagery) in the music itself, deploying icy chimes, oceans of pounding drums, thundering electric guitars, and field recordings of crackling fires. More recently, Matthew Houck, AKA Phosphoresent, has taken up a similar, although more sedate, songwriting style. His simple, mostly acoustic music (scarcely will you hear more than four chords in a song) is built into enormous, open spaces. Not as violent as Elverum, Houck's songs tend to expand via warm choruses of voices; long, relaxed arrangements; epic reverb; and, of course, field recordings of thunderstorms. Both men are also hugely concerned with nature in their lyrics, Elverum's towering mountains can stand in for the horrors of mortality while Houck sees the waves at night as both a reminder of that mortality and a sweet promise of all the beauty that awaits us until then.\r\n\r\nNow, considerÂ <strong>Jonas Bonnetta</strong>Â ofÂ <strong>Evening Hymns</strong>, the next in this line of autocratic, naturalistic songwriters with a flair for the climactic. Bonnetta described the recording ofÂ <strong>A-side â€œDead Deerâ€</strong>Â to Ampeater thusly:Â <em>â€œAll my recording in the past has been really hushed and this was the first time I really got to play loud on a recording. I remember the snowy streets outside of the gallery and the people walking by the windows as we tracked the guitar and I was jumping into each chord pretending I was in a rock and roll band.â€</em>Â Aside from just being awesome, this anecdote shows us the new Bonnetta (most of his previous work has been under his given name instead of the Evening Hymns moniker). The content may remain dark and confessional, but the music is expansive, enormous, like theÂ <em>â€œstars in the desertâ€</em>Â riddling the sky onÂ <strong>B-side â€œCedars,â€</strong>Â which is a spacious elegy built around an electronically manipulated recording of a piano, which was played by a friend and then recorded from one floor down. Bonnetta's innovations tend to come in this unobtrusive, humble way, in service of the songs. The piano drone is a perfect soundscape over which to set the direct address of â€œCedars,â€ yet it never sticks out as something done for the sake of strangeness or an air of capital-A Art. It doesn't even occur to you to ask what it is (it's pretty much impossible to tell that it was once a piano) because it sounds so perfectly matched to the content.\r\n\r\n<strong>Bonnetta</strong>Â is a native of the small town of Orono, Ontario, now transplanted to the urban environs of Toronto, but with a heart that still wanders out amongst the fields and forests. The image of cedar trees returns over and over again in his new albumÂ <strong>Spirit Guides</strong>, a record that gives you the same kind of feeling as gazing out at the tree-lined horizon at an hour when it seems like no one else in the world is awake. In the interests of full disclosure, I should probably tell you that this music was pretty much made for me: simple, lovely melodies; male vocals that sound as cracked and worn as old leather twinned in harmony with ethereally pure female vocals; mortality-heavy lyrics that hint at transcendence (<em>â€œeverybody's gonna live forever and no one ever dies anywayâ€</em>) and are delivered slightly behind the beat; huge climaxes with lush violins and flutes and pedal steel.Â <strong>Evening Hymns</strong>Â manages to walk the fine line between experimentation and melody, introspection and catharsis. They have songs, but they're not going to hit you over the head with them, choosing instead to let them slowly, organically unspool, revealing lyrics about dying that somehow make you feel good.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œDead Deerâ€</strong>Â commences with the gentle, three chord acoustic strums you'd expect, opening out into the simple lyrical trope of exhausted lovers collapsed on the floor. It is both sweet and slightly unnerving, mingling imagery of salvation and hand-holding sweetness with the implied sex and animal exhaustion of the original image:Â <em>â€œmy body it lies like an ark / like a bridge over yours in the darkâ€. And then, about 90 seconds into the song, a savage electric guitar breaks everything open into the alarming chorus of â€œand I lie like a dead deer / down in the cedars.â€</em>Â That guitar feeds an electricity directly into the song. Maybe it's naÃ¯ve to think so, but you can practically feel Bonnetta jumping up and down with each huge chord and all the energy that movement imparts. Also note the slight asymmetry of the guitar part just after the titular words, the way the chords come every two beats instead of the expected three, which lends a slight discomfort to the music that pushes it onward. The electric guitar is so enormous it practically strips the lyrics from the vocals for the rest of the song, leaving only the soaring melodies and the occasional word or two that breaks through. Midway through the song, strings sneak in underneath to push the song to even further heights as that aching chorus melody churns and churns before finally withdrawing back into the original verse pattern, this time led by a gentle, understated accordion. The entire song has the shape of a wave crashing on shore â€“ you can see the explosion coming from the opening chords, and soon the song is all sputtering foam and hungry fingers of water, but just afterwards, in that last instrumental verse, it looks as if none of it was ever there at all.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œCedarsâ€</strong>Â packs a lot of emotional weight for a B-side, opening with a minute of a slowly simmering drone before a hymnal chorus ofÂ <strong>Bonnettas</strong>Â sings the rubato verses in that unique voice of his, which shares the huskiness and rough imperfections of Houck (he doesn't crack his voice anywhere nearly as much as as Houck does, though. I know that drives some people crazy), yet can transcend those flaws to rise into a lovely pure sound, as on the linesÂ <em>â€œlit up the stars in the desert / reveal the bending of the night.â€</em>Â Gentle fingerpicking and a sublime chorus of reverby, female oohs then replaces the drone, surrounding the vulnerable yet undramatic lead vocals with a translucent cloud of sound that gradually yields back into the drone, topped with a cluster of breathy flugelhorns and flutes and resolving into, god bless him, a field recording of a thunderstorm. It's a device that almost shouldn't work, it's so frequently used, yet it does. There's really not a much better way to conjure up that much open space, that much power and melancholy. And, if any song deserves the stately solemnity of a rainstorm, it's an honest and serious elegy like this, written for Bonnetta's father and full of the kind of mixed up feelings that kind of absence has to create:Â <em>â€œSend for me my lanterns / send for me my maps / cause I lost all my direction / when you got caught in dark, dark traps.â€</em>Â The chorus ends with the wordsÂ <em>â€œeverybody's gonna live forever and no one ever dies anywayâ€</em>Â a hopeful thought of living on, if only in memory, gently and sadly countered by the song's last words, in which a gentle switch of focus lights up the singer's own eventual mortality:Â <em>â€œYou can't turn this boy around / getting older growing down.â€</em>\r\n\r\nThe Canadian press has been raving about Spirit Guides since its release last month, but us Yankees have been slow to pick up on things. I know it's hard for us to admit that sometimes the Canadians can do things better (i.e. health care), but you know, maybe the sting will go away after we all sit down and listen toÂ <strong>Evening Hymns</strong>Â for awhile. Let's not let pride keep us away from this lovely album, eh?",
