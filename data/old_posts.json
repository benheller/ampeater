Today in doing so you may have noticed that the first song is entitled <strong>â€œThe Only Living Goy in Jew York.â€</strong>  There are two basic responses to this song title, 1) a laugh, or whatever sound you make to express mirth while alone on the internet (mine is a sharp, tiny exhale of breath that makes it sound like someone just stabbed me with a pushpin) 2) a beetling of brows and slight canting forward of head and opening of mouth so as to indicate offense (actually this is what people do in conversation to indicate offense; I don't think people on the internet really adjust their faces to match their emotions. Think about what your face does next time you type 'lol'.  It's creepily blank, right?).  You'll probably react to the music in one of those two ways, too, especially the amazing off-key falsetto delivery of the song title, which sounds like a muppet after a night of guzzling 151 and torturing people for sexual pleasure. The song also uses the word â€œkikeâ€ prominently.  So, you know, people will probably divide into two camps pretty quickly re: <strong>Life Partners</strong>.  And you might not want to blast it at the office.  Or around my dad.\r\n\r\n\tOn the other hand, taking <strong>Life Partners</strong>, a band that often wears matching camo shirts and white pants live, seriously and at face value and then complaining about it is kind of like reading a novel written in a language you don't know and complaining that it didn't make sense. Take, for example, the hilariously tongue-in-cheek misogyny of the title track from their last record, <strong>Men Are Talking</strong>, which features lyrics like <em>â€œMen are talking / it's a gift from our minds to the world / we got these things called ideas wouldn't occur to you little girlsâ€</em> delivered in a kind of eager singspeak that manages to be a parody of the heterosexual cock worship of classic rock and eighties metal without being in any way cute. It's hard not to laugh when the gang vocals come in on the line <em>â€œWe are smart!â€</em>  And then there's a fucking amazing guitar solo. The thing about Life Partners that makes their records worth a damn beyond the initial humor of the songs is that they will take a concept that seems fit for a novelty song and then actually flesh it out with a musically varied and brutally heavy arrangement, complete with melodic hooks, constantly shifting sections, violent trumpet and guitar solos that shatter into nasty shards of noise.  \r\n\r\n\tNearly everything about the music of <strong>Life Partners</strong>, a quartet (power trio plus trumpet) fronted by <strong>Dave Dougan</strong>, bassist for Drag City's fantastic psych band Major Stars, has recognizable roots in the dudeliest of 70s and 80s rock: the half sung half-spoken vocals, the slow burning jams, the acoustic intros, the epic guitar solos, the simple catchy riffs, the palpable heaviness.  Yet it all gets taken and exaggerated in a way that makes it both funny and kind of threatening.  The guitar solos rip and bend all over the place, negotiating not just the usual blues scales but also a kind of loose, atonal Ornette Coleman territory, and then ascending beyond melody into pure, aggressive noise...and are sometimes delivered on the trumpet. The riffs are sometimes amelodic and dissonant. The vocals are periodically off-key in a way that is unsettling, and they take the rock n roll affectations of badassness and exaggerate them into a kind of rock n roll cartoon.  At the climax of the guitar solo on â€œMen Are Talking,â€ when Dougan is screaming the title phrase over and over at the top of his lungs you'll have forgotten that this was a joke, because it is heavy as fuck, awesome in the way rock music has of being awesome where there's now way to describe it without sounding like an inarticulate idiot (i.e. â€œawesomeâ€).\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the obvious controversial humor thing (I mean, the band has multiple songs about AIDS), <strong>A-side â€œThe Only Living Goy in Jew Yorkâ€</strong> brings out all the other key elements of the Life Partners sound: descending bassline, fill-heavy drums, quarter note keyboard chords, ridiculous falsetto, distorted trumpet counterlines (that's the trumpet in your left ear, headphone users) that devolve over the course of the song into raucous noise.  One of the best things about the band, especially live (they're a fantastic, sweaty, ear-frying live band), is the way <strong>Greg Kelley's</strong> trumpet and <strong>Mike Dupuy's</strong> guitar seem to challenge one another.  <strong>Life Partners</strong> is a jammy band, unlike most of the bands I like, and the real climax of the songs tends to come when the soloists are facing off, pushing each other higher and higher, often with <strong>Dougan's</strong> shrieky ad-libs over the top of the whole mess.  Live you get to see Dupuy's perfect guitar stance, Dougan ping ponging around the audience and Kelley redfaced and falling over backwards in a way that anyone who played trumpet in middle school can tell you will destroy your lips, but on the recordings you can still get some idea of the intensity of these duels (turn the volume up a lot).  Check out 2:05, where the trumpet and guitar accidentally strike the same note and then lock into that little ascending pattern together, repeating it until the song snaps with the tension and just kind of stops being a song\r\n\r\n\t<strong>B-side â€œWha' Happen?â€</strong>, named, I'm pretty sure, after Fred Willard's character in A Mighty Wind, follows a pretty similar pattern, albeit in a different order, with a huge introductory trumpet-guitar duel occupying the first few minutes before the vocal break.  The song quickly spins completely out of control, with the wildest sounds coming not from amps or pedals but from <strong>Dougan's</strong> pipes.  Early in minute four, when the chordal background falls away and you're just left with the three soloists climbing all over each other, it really brings home how bizarre this music is, bizarre in a way that's surprisingly easy to deal with when some rock-sounding chords are tying it to earth.  Then, of course, they bring it all home with an outtro that sounds like a slowed down, basement recorded version of a Van Halen song, keyboard sus chords and all.\r\n\r\n\tI mentioned the gang vocals on the line <em>â€œWe are smartâ€</em> earlier as something to laugh at. And it is. But the thing is, the <strong>Life Partners</strong> are smart.  Their lyrics are beyond vulgar, but they are also incredibly clever.  The music is difficult and noisy, but it is also constantly inventive and surprising.  \r\n\r\nIn short, <strong>Life Partners</strong> are weird, offensive, confusing, perverted and difficult, and I can't think of a better reason to listen to them.  I mean, who else is going to write us a song about a would be rapist who can't keep it up when his victim seems too willing, all built around the legal-sexual pun of the phrase â€œgets offâ€? Let's not make the mistake of taking too seriously the men who posed for that band photo.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right:40px; clear:both; width:40%\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"80px\" style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Wha' Happen?

The LPs, EPs and 7-inches float down the conveyor belt of some Wonka-like mega-gadget. When they get to the end of the belt, the claw lifts them up and drops them into their respective genre bins. Over here is a bin labeled â€œGlo-fi.â€ And over here is one labeled â€œShit-gaze.â€ And right next to that, â€œBaroque NPR-pop.â€ Online music culture is like the record shop on steroidsâ€”instead of just one wall being labeled â€œrockâ€ and the other â€œalternative,â€ we can now finger interminably through infinite cyber bins.But what about music that falls outside the reach of the judgmental music machinery? Thatâ€™s what <strong>KC Quilty </strong>isâ€”a young band whose tastes fell into a time capsule 15 years ago, leaving them to sound delightfully disconnected to anything current. If you had to peg a genre on it, itâ€™d be grunge. KC Quilty, a three-piece from Brooklyn, drags its drumbeats through sludge and soaks its guitar tones in slacker anti-energy. Its choruses swell with easy power while zephyrs of feedback swirl in and around the mix. The drones and dissonance are matched by the rock solid hooks. These are jams composed with moptops and bags under the eyes and a warm heart for 90â€™s rock radio.\n\n<em>â€œWhat we hear the most is, â€˜It reminds me of high school,'â€ </em>says lead singer/guitarist <strong>Sadie Dupuis</strong>. While itâ€™s an odd thing to note considering this group of early twenty-somethings and their peers would have just graduated high school in the mid-aughts, it still feels accurate. Their songs feel like the product of children of the 90â€™s pledging allegiance to their eraâ€™s alt-rock. And while itâ€™s unabashed in its loyalty to the decade Nirvana dominated, it still executes enough polite nods to the canonized indie-gods of the slacker movement to assure you of its credibility. Itâ€™s as much Malkmus as Cobain, and even more Pixies than Pearl Jam. <em>â€œWe have a tendency to tell people that we sound like Matador in 1993,â€</em> said Dupuis, who admits her admiration for label-greats Pavement, Guided By Voices and Helium.\n\nHelium, of the aforementioned three, is the comparison that requires the least effort in connecting the dots. <strong>Sadie</strong>â€”the band's founder, lead singer and principal songwriterâ€”is, after all, a girl. She sings sweetly but isnâ€™t interested in being cute. Lazy ears might make face-value claims of tough-girl group influences like Sleater-Kinney or (the super-dated) Veruca Salt. But whatâ€™s more striking in her voice is how cynical and unambitious it isâ€”two qualities that line up nicely with an appreciation for all things Malkmus and Pollard. During a discussion of taste, <strong>Julian Fader</strong>, drummer and co-core member, admits that he <em>â€œlikes the female singers more than she does. I like the quieter moments and Sadie wants to get all loud.â€ â€œI like Soundgarden,â€</em> Sadie chimes from the other side of the room.\n\nThe power of <strong>KC Quilty</strong>â€”a name that refers to the Clare Quilty character of Nabokovâ€™s Lolitaâ€”lies in that loud/soft dynamic. Like so many of the hits that swallowed whole the music industry in the early-to-mid 90s, <strong>Dupuis/Fader</strong> and co. take the formula of somber, tension-build in the verse into speaker-rattling catharsis in the chorus and absolutely run with it. In their best tracks, KC Quilty constructs its verses on lilting, lazy, drunken grooves. Typically, a Kim Deal-ian bass line (from the recently recruited <strong>Ethan Bassford</strong>) will serve as foundation while the guitar and vocals gradually drip moody atmosphere into the rising water-level of the song. The chorus, with its swell of power chords and power drums, is the sound of the water-level overtaking the rim.\n\nCase and point: <strong>â€œSupernova,â€ Side A</strong> of this here digital 7-inch. Itâ€™s a classic build and release. <strong>Dupuisâ€™s</strong> double-tracked vocals and down-tuned guitar crawl all over each other, thickening like a pea-soup fog filling the room. In the instant before the release of the chorus, <strong>Fader</strong> (who actually looks a bit like Dave Grohl with his stringy black hair tied behind his head) lays down a fill like heâ€™s loading a canon. And then comes the squallâ€”a dense bang that engorges just like Soundgardenâ€™s â€œBlack Hole Sun.â€ Now tell me youâ€™ve heard anything more badass in the last month than when Dupuis rhymes <em>â€œsupernovaâ€</em> with <em>â€œnice to know ya.â€</em> Besides a couple of overdubs, the track was recorded live and all together, which hints toward how powerful a KC Qulity show might be.\n\nSide B of the release, <strong>â€œJackshit,â€</strong> tweaks the formula a bit. Instead of utilizing the dynamics between verse and chorus, it strings you along for two and three quarter minutes with the increasing promise of something huge. The listener rides a groove built off a moody acoustic riff until a glitchy, Phil Selway-listening-to-DJ Shadow beat enters with a soft warning-siren of feedback. Then, at said two-and-three-quarter-minute mark, all but the feedback cuts out for a brief moment before the song is launched into the stratosphere, fulfilling the promise the track had offered up to now.\n\n<strong>â€œJackshitâ€</strong> was recorded at a creative performing arts camp for children in Connecticutâ€”during an electrical power outage, no lessâ€”that <strong>Fader</strong> and <strong>Dupuis</strong> worked at as counselors last summer. Fader made use of the tiny â€œsound studioâ€ where he gave his daily drumming lessons. <em>â€œIt was this 10-foot by 10-foot, bathroom-sized space,â€</em> said Fader. <em>â€œItâ€™s basically a little shed with a drumkit and a couple of amps.â€</em> Dupuis, who taught songwriting workshops, was assisted by one of her students for the songâ€™s lyricâ€”a mini-narrative about Jack and the Beanstalk. <em>â€œEvery day the kids would come and think of a topic and theyâ€™d have half an hour to write a song for it,â€</em> said Dupuis. <em>â€œAnd some idiot was like, â€˜BEANS will be the songwriting topic of the day!â€'</em> The sound collage in the outro of the song was pieced together by Fader, who carried around a Salvation Army tape recorder all summer and captured any sonic blips and bits that piqued his interest. One such bit included on the track is the campâ€™s Eastern European kitchen staff singing while huddled around a piano after camp hours. <em>â€œI donâ€™t know what the hellâ€¦itâ€™s some sort of song from home,â€</em> said Fader. <em>â€œItâ€™s either the Czech or Polish national anthem.â€</em> Whichever, Fader hurried to his bunk to grab the recorder, fumbling with the tape on the sprint back up the hill. <em>â€œI got like 35 seconds of them singing this song,â€</em> said Fader. <em>â€œIt sounded awesome.â€</em> Indeed.\n\n<strong>KC Quilty</strong>, in the early stages of their existence, have created a batch of songs (the band released a split 7-inch on December 10 and will release their first full LP <strong>Clover/Coriander</strong> on January 22) that manages to summarize the good bits of an historical period that a ton of music fans hold a fondness for. And instead of coming off as a tired retread, it feels entirely new among their audacious, genre-breeding contemporaries. Itâ€™s directness in style-ripping is not the result of a failure to birth new ideas; itâ€™s the result of the confidence KC Quilty has in its taste and abilities. There are those who strive on crafting new forms of sound and those who strive on streamlining a pre-existing formula. The contemporary music scene survives on both. Itâ€™s just a refreshing breath of 15-year-old air to hear a band choose the latter.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Steve Glauber</p>\n\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-306\" title=\"sidea\" alt=\"sidea\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sidea-150x150.png\" width=\"75\" /></td>\n<td>Side A - Supernova [audio:AEM047 KC Quilty/01 Supernova.mp3|titles=Supernova|artists=KC Quilty]</td>\n<td><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-307\" title=\"sideb\" alt=\"sideb\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sideb-150x150.png\" width=\"75\" /></td>\n<td>Side B - Jackshit [audio:AEM047 KC Quilty/02 Jackshit.mp3|titles=Jackshit|artists=KC Quilty]</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM047 KC Quilty.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\n</div>",

Most of these ideas are bad: maracas, choirs, bassists wearing hats, putting a pool on the album cover. These are all bad ideas.\r\n\r\nBut letâ€™s break this down further. If we were to construct a band-generator from whateverâ€™s left of Brian Wilsonâ€™s bathtub, that spinning 9-necked guitar from Cheap Trick, and the foreclosed ruins of Lou Perlmanâ€™s boy dungeon, the device, no matter how complex on the inside, would only need to have two inputs:<em> â€œadjectiveâ€</em> and <em>â€œnoun,â€</em> or, as it states in the manual, <em>â€œideaâ€</em> and <em>â€œthing.â€</em> Wonderful! We have just given birth to Whitesnake, Darkthrone, Big Black, Lightning Bolt, and, why not, Cheap Trick. This construct is useful not just because you can make new bands forever, but because the layman can decipher what heâ€™s about to listen to before he even hits play. Whitesnake sounds like a huge penis, Darkthrone sounds like a malevolent, slightly smaller penis, and Big Black sounds like Steve Albiniâ€™s idea of Parliament were Parliament to turn into a...oh wait, never mind. The idea begets the name begets the band. Click, spit, another gem off the assembly line.\r\n\r\nBut what are the limits of this magical machine? What function would fry the system? Repetition of terms? No, thereâ€™s Duran Duran, the adjective of Duran modifying the noun Duran for extra clarity. Nonsense? Nope, Kajagoogoo comes out looking pretty sleek. These are all New Wave bands, of course, and should be expected to communicate sympathetically with the motherboard.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s where the story starts, though: the other day I was tinkering with the BG (I have one in my basement), and, completely by accident, came across the killer combo: â€œDinoâ€, â€œWalrusâ€. <strong>Dinowalrus</strong>. Sparks flew everywhere. There was an explosion inside the casing. The steel bubble split open like the pod from Bodysnatchers or Cocoon. Before me were three dudes: One was tall and lanky and looked like an anorexic Slash. One was Asian, slightly shorter. The last one, holding drum sticks, resembled a twelve-year old. He had braces for Christsakes! We got to talking. I went to one of their gigs. They were nice guys.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting the breakdown a few days later, I came across the error log, lines and lines of perfect code and then, right above the bit where the whole system went to shit, a simple message: <em>â€œWhat is the idea?â€</em>\r\n\r\nEven as we approach the inevitable Singularity, Machines still arenâ€™t really that good at abstract thinking. To the CPU, an idea is really just an â€œideaâ€: â€œHateâ€, â€œWarâ€, â€œLoveâ€, â€œPeaceâ€. Cool ideas. The problem with <strong>Dinowalrus</strong> is that instead of having an â€œideaâ€, they inverted the generatorâ€™s fundamental equation. Dinowalrus, like the fucked-up primordial soup-beast they name drop, generated their own idea.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ll be honest. I donâ€™t really know what that idea is. But who does when it comes to a paradigm shift like this? Itâ€™s like asking someone circa year 0 what the idea of God is. Heâ€™d be like: <em>â€œWhat? God is God, man.â€</em> I, who, some 2009 years later, can rattle off the Cliff Notes of contemporary atheism without hesitation, am forced in this case to harken back to that old-time ancestor: <em>â€œDinowalrus is Dinowalrus, man.â€</em>\r\n\r\nSo what do they sound like: a cyborg thrash collective doing body percussion; what would happen if they jacked a Gibson SG into the Matrix instead of Neoâ€™s skull; field recordings from a future where we all live inside computers.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Mae Shi </strong>remix of <strong>â€œNuke Duke 'Emâ€</strong> off <strong>Dinowalrusâ€™s</strong> forthcoming record <strong>%</strong> runs the gamut from eponymous video game questing to white club spazz dancing, nixing the bandâ€™s ambient tendencies in favor of heavily textured breakbeats and clipped synths over an, um HEALTH-y guitar rumble and breathy, humanoid vox. Whatâ€™s amazing here is how malleable the source material seems to be. Dinowalrusâ€™s music, already existing in a state of near-infinite recombination and remix, is rendered by the Mae Shi not as greater or less than, but precisely, literally as the sum of its parts. This is the real Shi-house, not a banger for the club circuit, but banged up circuits for clubgoing computers.\r\n\r\nB-side, the older track <strong>â€œDole,â€</strong> resembles some kind of self-conscious Italo-disco forgery distilled with an infusion of Pac-man cherries and imported axle grease from 1980s Detroit. Jackinâ€™ beats, arpeggiator runs, a vocal take that sounds like it was recorded in the Cave of Montesinos: its like workout music for sedentary MMORPG addicts, the starter kit for <em>â€œ8 Minute Abs(straction).â€</em> This stuff makes you stronger, for sure, reinforcing neural pathways with titanium and figuring out algorithms for life after death.\r\n\r\nYou donâ€™t put ideas like these into the band generator. Version 2.0, already rebuilding itself downstairs as I write this, can sentiently remix itself while my weak biological body falls asleep onto the keyboard. <strong>Dinowalrus</strong> is the sound of that construction project, a new kind of fractal culture-jamming where all material is fair game, where all evolution is instantaneous.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Dole [audio:AEM048 Dinowalrus/02 Dole.mp3|titles=Dole|artists=Life Dinowalrus]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Nuke Duke 'Em (Mae Shi Remix) [audio:AEM048 Dinowalrus/01 Nuke Duke Em - Mae Shi Remix.mp3|titles=Nuke Duke Em|artists=Dinowalrus]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear:both; padding-top:20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM048 Dinowalrus.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

I wonder if their children will unearth their MySpace pages in 30 years). Anyway, as we have gotten more and more used to hearing home recordings by people who don't have much experience in the realm of...well, recording, we've gotten more and more used to low fidelity, to everything clipping.Â  Lo-fi wasn't invented by the internet generation, of course, it's always been a marker of authenticity and anti-top 40 pop music (think of Daniel Johnston bleating his immensely effective songs of pain into a tape recorder), but we may be the first group of consumers to send some kid straight from making blown out tapes in his basement to having public drug meltdowns at European festivals within, what, six months? Low fidelity recording is acceptable to a wider swathe of audience than ever before.Â  Those of us who have grown up listening to streaming MySpace mp3s have learned to listen past the blurry audio when necessary and to appreciate it as an aesthetic of both intention and necessity. It could even be considered a backlash against the unnatural cleanness and dryness of digital production, which removes the warmth of occasional tape saturation of most of our beloved analog recordings and makes it sound like listening to a rock band suspended in a vacuum.Â  Cambridge, MA, band <strong>You and Your Pointy Ears</strong>, the brainchild of <strong>Spenser Gralla</strong> (when he's not busy being in all his other bands) fits neatly into the lo-fi pop category, but instead of the angsty numbness of bands like Wavves, You and Your Pointy Ears channels the badass, dance party stomp of old school garage weirdos like The Monks and country rockers like CCR.\r\n\r\nWhen I first heard <strong>You and Your Pointy Ears</strong>, it was late on a Monday night at Zuzu, a tiny, red-walled club in Cambridge, frequented by the ex members of every great Boston band that we could have sworn was going to blow up but never quite did. These people all have the authoritative and tragic weight of deposed royalty as they down bottle after golden bottle of high life. I was sitting at the bar shooting the shit with someone or other when You and Your Pointy Ears started playing, and though I hadn't come to watch the bands, soon I was standing in the crush around <strong>Spenser Gralla</strong> and his drummer for the night (presumably <strong>Noah Bond</strong>, Gralla's bandmate from one of his main projects, the rumbling psych-pop group <strong>Doomstar</strong>), first nodding my head and grinning, and soon joining everyone else in hopping around with beer in hand.Â  Let me tell you, it was a party.Â  High lifes were held up high in every hand, foaming over their rims and soaking coat sleeves, and no one seemed to care.Â  Everyone just kept dancing.\r\n\r\nThe thing that makes <strong>You and Your Pointy Ears</strong> great is this mix of old and new.Â  You could probably lump them in with the unfortunately named â€œshitgazeâ€ bands without anyone rolling their eyes at your naivetÃ©, but really what You and Your Pointy Ears does is play pop songs that you can dance to but that don't make you feel like you're in a jeans commercial aimed at hip, suburban youth.Â  This is more difficult than it sounds.Â  Pretty much every single indie rock band aimed at making dance music sounds either neutered or hideously dated.Â  Good rock music has to have roots and wings.Â  Throwbacky bands can catch on for about a year, but they're always the butt of jokes for the next ten afterwards (Brian Setzer Orchestra anyone?), and bands that are too focused on innovation largely go unlistened to, which, when you're trying to make pop music, is sort of a problem.Â  Gralla's songs are pretty simple, rooted in a lot of sixties pop song writing in the same way that, believe it or not, the best Nirvana songs are. Consider the drum break during the chorus of <strong>A-side â€œUnder Your Feetâ€</strong>, in which the drums suddenly drop into that old saw girl group drum beat (as in the first verse of â€œLeader of the Packâ€), or the surf rock double backbeat on <strong>B-side â€œNight at the Moviesâ€</strong> that follows the wicked drum fills out of the static verse sections and into the choruses, underscoring that last Brian Wilsonian ooh that hangs out above the crashing waves of drums and guitar like ocean mist.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œUnder Your Feetâ€</strong> is a loose stomping rock and roll song with no wasted moments, exactly the kind of thing <strong>You and Your Pointy Ears</strong> excels at.Â  It's got a slightly bizarre verse chord progression, following those descending barre chords out of the key and then back in, and that madly catchy, repetitive chorus that hits the upbeats so hard it feels like it should go tumbling along forever.Â  Catch the way the bass drum mirrors the rhythm of the vocals there, creating that tension that makes you want to move.Â  Also, â€œI love to see you go / but I hate to watch you leaveâ€ is an great inversion of the old clichÃ© used cleverly to invoke the kind of mixed feelings in relationships where you let someone walk all over you.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œNight at the Moviesâ€ </strong>kicks in with a little more electricity, going straight into some Walkmen-style all-downstroke strumming on the electric, rolling 16<sup>th</sup> notes on the rack tom, sleigh bells on the downbeats.Â  It's a perfect tension-release set up for the choruses when the song explodes into that double backbeat mentioned above.Â  It's something so simple, but so powerful. The whole verse long you can't help but wait for it, and then when it finally comes, after that terrifically savage drum fill by <strong>Bond</strong>, it's so satisfying.Â  It is, like all great pop songs, a tiny exercise in delayed gratification, and that final falsetto melody is just sublime.\r\n\r\n<strong>You and Your Pointy Ears</strong> has the knack for making great independent pop music: pop songs that are just weird enough to be interesting and weird songs that are just poppy enough to get stuck in your head.Â  This would be enough to make them worthwhile on its own, but add to it enough rock n roll blood to make a club full of drunken Boston rock royalty get up and shake their asses and a lo-fi aesthetic that actually mirrors the feeling of being in a tiny dark room and getting pulverized by the enormous sound of a rock band playing ten feet away and you have a band worth spilling your beer to. I am eagerly awaiting their 2010 full length, but for now at least we have this handy Ampeater 7-inch.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Night at the Movies [audio:AEM049 You and Your Pointy Ears/02 Night at the Movies.mp3|titles=Night at the Movies|artists=You and Your Pointy Ears]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Under Your Feet [audio:AEM049 You and Your Pointy Ears/01 Under Your Feet.mp3|titles=Under Your Feet|artists=You and Your Pointy Ears]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear:both; padding-top:20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM049 You and Your Pointy Ears.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Itâ€™s a new decade everyone, and even if the oughts gave birth to more micro-revivals and quantum genres than anyone could care to keep track of, I think itâ€™s safe to say that rock came out sounding not only alright, but perhaps even more rigorously defined than at any other point in its now officially geriatric lifespan. Remember the opening seconds of Radioheadâ€™s Hail To The Thief back in 2005, that buzzy sound of a guitar getting plugged in and the nasty hiss of speakers. After Kid A and Amnesiac, it was like, oh, amplifiers! That was rock in the 2000s. Whatâ€™s that crappy sound? Oh, rock! After a decadeâ€™s worth of electro-shock therapy and drainpipes posturing, the dirty, scuzzy nature of the beast still persisted like a bad personality trait.\r\n\r\n      Thatâ€™s why, I think, <strong>WALLcreeper</strong>, a four-piece from Boston, sound so fucking on. This is some gristly, pretty music, the kind of thing that makes you want to grow a beard, start a garden, and learn how to do some real motorcycle maintenance. Itâ€™s not Zen, necessarily, and certainly not Nirvana. But, listened to on the right pair of headphones or shit-tastic car stereo, itâ€™s not that far from either. If you planted these songs in the ground, they would sprout into really great-looking carnivorous plants.\r\n\r\n      Check out the <strong>A-side â€œShould Have Known Better,â€</strong> the longest three-minute rock song of the year. These guys play at a dinosaur pace, slow, hungry, casually devastating, evolving the track like a time-lapse photo of a tundra or some past-its-prime mill town. It sounds natural, like dirt migrating cross-country or stones eroding into weird shapes. Tremolo-picking, half-buried vocals, gastrointestinal bass rumblings...the whole thing accumulates like sediment sitting at the bottom of a river filled with liquor.\r\n\r\n      People mention shoegaze when talking about this band, and while thereâ€™s all kinds of Ride-ish echoes in the project, I think the tag is a bit reductive, and not that accurate. Shoegaze was, from the Madchester groups through My Bloody Valentine, and even today with look-backs like A Place To Bury Strangers, never really about distortion and reverb and huge textural washes, but about being a kind of club music for antisocial white people who couldnâ€™t dance. <strong>WALLcreeper</strong> grooves, for sure, but the mission of this music is different, closer, in my opinion, to groups like The Drones, or, hell, even The Dead Weather, in that it belongs in beer-reeking bars rather than actual parties, not as a tool for meeting fellow damaged and agoraphobic people, but an excuse to get into a brawl. Thereâ€™s a bestial swagger to this style, interlocking guitar harmonies and feedback duels and woolly-mammoth drums dealing damage rather than hooks.\r\n\r\n      Nowhere is this more apparent than on the B-side, the justifiably 8-minute <strong>â€œEmpty in the Eyes.â€</strong> Itâ€™s rare that you want bands to work on this kind of scale, but <strong>WALLcreeper</strong> pulls off the epic so well that you wonder if the mp3-induced extinction of the album track really was a tragedy worth reversing. Itâ€™s not so much that the ideas of the band need this much space to breathe, but that the sound itself, like aurora borealis or the Grand Canyon, is best observed in the open. Rising, falling, tension, release are the important compositional components here, so much so that I would argue â€œEmpty in the Eyesâ€ is less a song than a workout in the best possible sense, a deep-play exercise in atmospheric rock measured on a geologic scale. The thing buries you.\r\n\r\n      The 2000s, I think, did a lot to tame the rock monster. Riffs got compressed, drums got sequenced, vocals got autotuned. Consider <strong>WALLcreeper</strong> the glorious antithesis to all that, a band thatâ€™s down to throw mud and shit all over itâ€™s platonically gorgeous songs. Fuck Spike Jonze. This is where the wild things are. \r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Empty in the Eyes [audio:AEM050 WALLcreeper/02 Empty in the Eyes.mp3|titles=Empty in the Eyes|artists=WALLcreeper]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Should Have Known Better [audio:AEM050 WALLcreeper/01 Should Have Known Better.mp3|titles=Should Have Known Better|artists=WALLcreeper]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear:both; padding-top:20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM050 WALLcreeper.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\"><img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float:right; \" title=\"Lohio\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/lohio.jpg\" alt=\"Lohio\" width=\"300\" />As a freshman in high school, I managed to select an almost impossibly horrible schedule of classes that led me on an epic walk across the full length of our sprawling campus not once but twice each day. I was 14, and September and October were shitty and cold, as they usually are at New England boarding schools. Then, in late November a wonderful thing happened--Apple invented the iPod. In a split second this little white box with its massive 4gb (HA!) hard drive turned those 15 minute walks into the most highly anticipated stretches of my daily routine. I'd spend the better part of the previous evening selecting the perfect combination of songs for each walk, thinking that I could somehow transform this wholly banal ritual into some kind of cinematic experience. The idea was to crank the tunes as loud as my little earbuds would go, and to imagine seeing myself walking through the snow as though it were a dramatically framed cut scene from The Graduate or some equally introspective indie art film. Unfortunately, my music library was at the time limited to about 20 classic rock albums that I'd appropriated via Napster. Needless to say, the movie playing in my head probably looked a lot more like Easy Rider than I would have hoped. Anyways, Spring rolled around, I got a bike, and my once cherished iPod mega-walk went the way of the dinosaurs--that is, until <strong>Lohio</strong> landed in the Ampeater submissions box.\r\n\r\nWhether it's the delicate, almost fractured vocals on <strong>\"Grandpa's Chaise\" </strong>or the boisterous synths on <strong>\"End of Summertime,\"</strong> this 7-inch from <strong>Lohio </strong>is the perfect soundtrack to, well, life. The arrangements are instrumentally sparse but constitutionally strong, striking a fine balance between irresistible catchiness and harmonic indecision, the combination of which keeps listeners stumbling along, eager to dive into the next groove but cautious of what might be around the corner. I get the impression that Lohio wears many musical hats, and that what we have on this here 7-inch are but two of a multitude, from a band that draws inspiration from more genres, sub-genres, and faux-genres than the now infamous <a href=\"http://cache0.bigcartel.com/product_images/8963711/DSC00004-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">\"genre shirt\"</a>. It all boils down to something called \"indie pop/rock,\" whatever that means, but goddamn it's good. I suppose that's why Lohio seems to be poised for greatness, and why (more than most bands featured on Ampeater) they're being acknowledged as rising stars on the scene.\r\n\r\n<strong>Greg Dutton</strong> (vocals, guitar), <strong>Erik Cirelli</strong> (guitar, effects),  <strong>Liz Adams</strong> (bass, vocals), and <strong>Sven Stens</strong> (drums) took their home town of Pittsburgh by storm, and have been voted amongst the city's best bands in numerous local polls. This early success earned them opening slots for indie giants Vampire Weekend, Ra Ra Riot, and Grizzly bear. Thus thrust into the national spotlight, Lohio found themselves featured on MTV, KEXP and the legendary KCRW. The <strong>Lohio EP's</strong> critical success was almost inevitable--the cogs were in place. Musically, it's an incredibly sophisticated album that sits confidently in the healthy middleground between shameless pop and introspective shoegaze. It's the record I wish Mojave 3 had made after Spoon and Rafter, and it accomplishes with taste and grace what Puzzles Like You struggled rather awkwardly to achieve--unpredictable yet melodic pop music that simultaneously engages and dodges its audience. If I could turn the world down and Lohio up, I'd do so in a second.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lohio</strong> made an interesting decision for this 7-inch--to use the first two songs from their <strong>Lohio EP</strong>, but to reverse the order. What we end up with is an A-side that hits right out of the gate, and a slow build B-side that leaves listeners emotionally and (if you play it loud enough) physically drained. <strong>Side A \"End of Summertime\"</strong> could be the theme to a TV show on Nickelodeon, but for a single harmonic decision that sends the song in a wholly new direction. On a single held note, the song deviates from its open-armed pop sensibilities and delivers a descending vocal harmony that casts the shadow of Fall over an otherwise endless musical summertime. It's a brilliant move, as though Lohio were pushing that imaginary carrot a couple more inches away from the horse's mouth, just when it seemed most likely that the poor creature could sneak a bite. As a result, this is one of those perpetually looped songs on my iTunes playlist--I start it again as soon as it ends, hoping that one of these days it'll give up and deliver the hook that I so badly want it to hand over. But, somewhere deep down I know it never will, and that's the beauty of the song. If it gave us an obvious and gratifying harmonic resolution, it wouldn't be worth 10, 50, or even 100 listens--we'd have our way with it and move along. In so depriving its listeners of this cheap thrill, it gains a deeper and more enduring strength. Good luck making it to the B-side.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fivetunes.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Five Tunes</a> described <strong>Lohio</strong> with such perfect accuracy that I have to appropriate a line. They wrote, <em>\"Itâ€™s like the song is saying 'Oh God, I feel so much that I can only express my emotions through this awesome guitar solo.' Bam. Great band.\"</em> <strong>B-Side \"Grandpa's Chaise\"</strong> lets the band's delicate emotional character shine through a bit, and if it were the only track I'd ever heard by Lohio, it would still make my personal favorites list. <strong>Dutton's</strong> voice is far from perfect, but it's the technical flaws that make it something truly special. It sounds fragile, like it could just break at any moment, and to some extent, it does. The song opens with a struggling verse so wrought with introspection that the vocals just dissolve. Dutton and <strong>Adams</strong> sing in subtle harmony: \"<em>The shade couldn't fight off the sun, it cross the room, it woke us up in bed at the start of the day, as I laid in your arms on grandfather's chaise.\"</em> The song then departs on a guitar solo to end all guitar solos. I haven't heard something this crushing since the break on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". When the vocals re-enter, they do so with deliberate confidence, shouting <em>\"and the walls that we built up, they came down to the ground they were trampled like dust, and the thought of giving up, it made no sense at all it was so obvious. In short, it was love.\"</em> It's such a human song--most of us have at one point or another been in that room and thought those thoughts. Lohio calls us into their world, pulls us onto the chaise, invites us to create or recreate that scenario in our heads, and does so with a sincerity and complexity that makes this song truly memorable. Hell, I should start carrying around a guitar, just in case I have to explain something and words won't quite do the trick.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lohio's</strong> one to keep an eye on--they're out on a quest to promote the new EP, and I would put my money on these guys becoming an indie rock staple when their next full length drops. In the meantime, if you need to find me I'll be the guy standing by the fountain in Central Park with giant headphones on, blasting the solo from \"Grandpa's Chaise\" on repeat.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Grandpa's Chaise [audio:AEM051 Lohio/02 Grandpas Chaise.mp3|titles=Grandpa's Chaise|artists=Lohio]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - End of Summertime [audio:AEM051 Lohio/01 End of Summertime.mp3|titles=End of Summertime|artists=Lohio]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear:both; padding-top:20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM051 Lohio.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

When we decided not to have a bass player, much of that was driven by the challenge that presents. You have to work your way through a song idea differently when you can't count on that thick bassline to bring it back in from a drum break, for example. So you wind up structuring things in less common ways, and we're finding that much more interesting and satisfying right now. The same is true of melody, with our violin. We use the violin as a melody, on top of the music, which challenges the vocal melodies to try to rival it if they're going to get the attention in your ear. It's a tension in the music, I think, and there's a certain appeal in that tension.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Redbird Fever</strong> combines quirky pop sensibilities with a healthy experimental vibe.Â  Their songs are short and snappy (the longest track on their EP is only 2:47) and remarkably unpretentious.Â  As they explain it, <em>â€œspiraling violin and vocal melodies offset looped, angular guitar riffs and dynamic lyrics about loss, heartache, and alienation.â€ </em>That's all true enough, but thereâ€™s a charm to Redbird Fever that extends beyond that, something that one canâ€™t put a finger on so easily.Â  It might have something to do with the intimacy of the lyrics, which seem more like fragments of a bedside conversation orÂ  a stream of consciousness than something premeditated.Â  Or maybe, as <strong>Hogaboom</strong> suggests, it has something to do with the interplay between violin and vocals.Â  Or maybe it's the subtle tension between <strong>Wainman</strong><strong>'s</strong> and Hogaboomâ€™s vocal melodies, usually in unison but diverging at key moments.Â  Or perhaps Iâ€™ve missed it entirely.Â  Iâ€™ll let you be the judge of that.Â  Itâ€™s time to press play on <strong>A-side \"It's a Metaphor, Dear!\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>7â€¦ 6â€¦ 5â€¦ 4â€¦ 3â€¦ 2â€¦ 1â€¦!!!</em> Lately, <strong>Redbird Fever</strong> has been opening their shows with this song and having the crowd help them count down.Â  <strong>Hogaboom</strong> explains, <em>â€œwhen we hit one and start the song, there's a really nice sharing that happens with us and everyone who was counting.â€</em> <strong>\"</strong><strong>Itâ€™s a Metaphor, Dear!\"</strong> is the perfect opener.Â  A percussive guitar riff and peppy violin melody kick things off with gusto while the refrain takes on a more pensive air.Â  A heavier riff-based outro gives the band a chance to build.Â  As advertised, \"Itâ€™s a Metaphor, Dear!\" is an extended metaphor.Â  <em>â€œI think that I would like to live in her heart it may sound stupid but i'd have to bring both my cats.Â  Maybe it'd be better if I were a red blood cell, flow through her aorta and down through her left ventricle.â€</em> But the mere act of declaring the song a metaphor adds a sarcastic twist, as if to say it's a metaphor for a metaphor.Â  Certainly, it's not to be taken at face value.Â  Hogaboom explains, <em>â€œit's about love, but it's got this insincerity wrapping it upâ€</em>\r\n\r\nAs I keep asserting, <strong>Redbird Fever</strong> is a band that likes to push itself, and nowhere is this more evident than in <strong>B-side \"Sometimes Things Get Broken</strong>.\" Â The band explains thatÂ  <em>â€œ[it] started out as an experiment, trying to challenge ourselves to do a song with no musically separate chorus, and try to make it apparent using mostly vocals.â€ </em> It's a test they pass with flying colors.Â  The beautiful vocal harmonies on the title line, <em>â€œsometimes things get broken,â€</em> help it to rise above the mix but when <strong>Hogaboom's</strong> and <strong>Wainman's</strong> voices diverge on the word <em>broken</em>, with Hogaboom cutting it short and Wainman continuing on, the sense of togetherness literally gets broken.Â  In another instance, Wainman sings <em>â€œdon't tell me 1 and 1 make 1 againâ€</em> while Hogaboom shouts bitterly over her, <em>â€œit's subtraction, it's addition,â€</em> evoking a conflict between lovers. Although \"Sometimes Things Get Broken\" lacks a distinct verse/chorus structure it's musically quite progressive.Â  Unusual textures like handclaps and whispers help keep things interesting on this track.\r\n\r\n<strong>Redbird Fever</strong> plans to enter the studio again in early 2010 to record a full length album.Â  In the mean time, they will be performing, the next show scheduled at 4th Ave Tav in Olympia, WA on January 23<sup>rd</sup>.Â  And February is right around the corner.Â  Would it be too much to hope for fourteen new songs?\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Sometimes Things Get Broken [audio:AEM052 Redbird Fever/02 Sometimes Things Get Broken.mp3|titles=Sometimes Things Get Broken|artists=Redbird Fever]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - It's a Metaphor, Dear!

That said, we're not about to cut our catalog one song short without doing something cool to compensate. After all, these songs are like family to us. So, we present you with a new 7-inch from Strawberry Hands, sans review, as a bit of a teaser. These tracks are both from the magnificent albumÂ <strong>Palaces Upon Palaces</strong>, which can be had via our <a href=\"http://www.ampeatermusic.com/store\">store page</a> for ten bucks.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Big Ghost [audio:AEM001re Strawberry Hands/02 Big Ghost.mp3|titles=Big Ghost|artists=Strawberry Hands]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Visions of Excess [audio:AEM001re Strawberry Hands/01 Visions of Excess.mp3|titles=Visions of Excess|artists=Strawberry Hands]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM001re Strawberry Hands.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Munzing</strong> wrote a â€˜suiteâ€™ of experimental pop  songs on a beat up piano deep within the Vermont Woods. Eventually Munzing emerged from the  woods to share his music with guitarist<strong> M.  Hagan</strong> and bassist <strong>T. Gevry</strong>, both former members of the Burlington-based  Lendaway, and drummer <strong>C. Mathieu</strong>, with whom Munzing had previously  played alongside in the band Tell No One.Â  Within a few months  Munzingâ€™s songs had been transformed into space age psychedelic pop  hits and the group had coalesced into My Dearest Darling.Â  A slew  of shows in Vermont and NYC opening for bands such as White Rabbits  and The Fiery Furnaces earned My Dearest Darling a small following and  before long they were hard at work on their first album.Â  The LP,  self titled, was recorded over the span of several months in basements,  multiple studios, and ultimately in Munzing's bedroom.Â  Munzing  explains that <em>â€œeven though finishing the record myself took longer  than I anticipated, recording on my own allowed me to experiment without  any time or financial restrictions and I was able to get closer to the  sound I was looking for.â€</em> The product of these sessions  wasÂ  finally released in December of 2009 and can be downloaded  at <a href=\"http://www.mydearestdarling.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.mydearestdarling.com</a>.Â  Keyboardist Z. Gunderson has joined  the band to <em>â€œtake over synth duties for live showsâ€</em> and My  Dearest Darling is plotting to take the North East by storm in the Spring  of 2010.\r\n\r\n<strong>My Dearest Darling</strong> is  theatrical in a way reminiscent of Radiohead or Muse.Â  <strong>A-Side  \"The Perfect Vice\"</strong> is a dizzying vortex of a song.Â  An 88-key piano roll grabs your attention  from the get-go and pulls you into a haze of warbling synths and frenzied  drums.Â  A relentlessly fast 6/8 feel pulses throughout the song  from start to finish, meshing astonishingly well with <strong>Munzing's</strong> slow but determined vocals which float stoically over the chaos.Â   His voice is appropriately breathy on the lows but on the high notes  takes on a sense of apocalyptic urgency.Â  The song's got enough  hooks within its verse/chorus structure to keep the listener captivated  for its longevity.Â  Nevertheless, the  breakdown at about 2:45 provides refreshing respite from the unkempt  chaos and gives each instrument a little time to shine.Â  First  the drums get their moment, blasting their way through a few residual  piano notes with a tribal tom-tom beat.Â  One by one, the band jumps  back in.Â  <strong>Gevry's</strong> ascending bass line, which anchors the  song down, floats to theÂ Â  front of the mix before a syncopated  piano riff is layered on top of it.Â  Synths and guitars follow  en suite and, at last, the chorus.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-Side \"Decay\"</strong> is more  ethereal, lacking the in-your-face frenzy of <strong>\"The Perfect Vice.\"</strong> As <strong>Munzing</strong> comically phrases it, <em>â€œits  a slow burner but rewarding assuming the listener has the patience to  not hit 'next' even after the song is interrupted on their iPhone by  their mom asking, â€˜do you have enough sweaters for winter this year?â€™â€ </em> Actually, my first listen was interrupted not by my mother but by my  computer, beeping to warn me that my battery level was critically low.Â   Obediently, I powered down, but as soon as I found an outlet, I was  ready for another listen.Â  In a strange way \"Decay\" was already stuck  in my head and yet I couldn't even me remember how it went.Â Â   All I knew as that I had to hear the rest of the song.Â  I returned  to it with an an acute sense of of <em>dÃ©jÃ    vu</em> or, better yet, <em>dÃ©jÃ  Ã©coutÃ©</em>, but with no conscious  memory of what I was hearing.Â  I suppose what I'm trying to say  is that \"Decay\" is not a catchy song by any stretch of the imagination  but it's completely immersive. Arpeggiating  synthesizers cascade through each ear evoking vintage Pink Floyd.Â   A tension pervades throughout the song, even in the softest sections..Â   Sure it's chill but that's is not due to a lack of energy but stems  from a suppressed energy t hat is constantly on the verge of bursting  free.Â  And in the guitar solo, it finally does.Â  \"Decay\" ends  on the high note of the guitar solo and fizzles away, like an exploding  supernova dissipating into space.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Decay [audio:AEM053 My Dearest Darling/02 Decay.mp3|titles=Decay|artists=My Dearest Darling]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - The Perfect Vice [audio:AEM053 My Dearest Darling/01 The Perfect Vice.mp3|titles=The Perfect Vice|artists=My Dearest Darling]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM053 My Dearest Darling.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\"><img src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Tony-the-Bookie-300x198.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Tony the Bookie\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px;\" />The story goes that <strong>Anthony Confalone</strong> (AKA â€œ<strong>Tony the Bookie</strong>â€, a moniker acquired in his long residency as the booking agent for Somerville, MA club PA's Lounge, but one which nicely doubles as an indication of the kind of seedy, beer-soaked, mortality-heavy, miserable bastard country music Confalone writes), before each take of every song on his debut full-length <strong>Tony the Bookie presents...The Tony the Bookie Orchestra!</strong>, lifted a glass of Dewars to his mouth and took a swig. I probably should have swapped the glass out for a bottle, and the Dewars for some kind of bourbon, but hey, this is a music blog with some journalistic standards.Â  There's something to the classiness of the scotch, though, for despite the roughshod misery of a bunch of dudes howling <em>â€œon the day that you left me/I knew my life would never ever be the saaaaaaaaameâ€</em> in a unison so wild there's actually about a major second span between the various notes, Confalone's songs are incredibly well-written and well-crafted. He may be drunk, but he knows what he's doing.\r\n<strong>\r\nConfalone</strong> describes the band as <em>a bunch of weirdos trying to play country music,</em> and that's about as accurate and concise a description as you're going to get from me. The genre touchstones are all there: lyrics about sin and church bells, twangy lead guitars, ever-present death, plaintive pedal steel, that high lonesome voice-cracking sound (altered here a bit by the fact that Confalone actually has quite a low voice), those sinking melismas at the end of each line, but <strong>the Bookie Orchestra</strong> never sinks into pastiche or self-parody.Â  The musical template may be country, but the content of the songs (mostly pain, like in any good country song) resonates beyond the framework in which they're delivered, and most importantly, Confalone never steps over the line into weird authenticity gaming by, say, singing in a put-on southern accent. This has been a pet peeve of mine ever since I noticed that about half of American rock bands today sing with fake British accents. Don't get me wrong, I like Gang of Four too, guys, and there is always an extent to which influence is unconsciously absorbed, which is fine.Â  Someone writing country inspired music is likely to pick up a little bit of twang just like an aspiring suburban MC is probably going to pick up and throw around some slang he didn't learn on his neatly landscaped streets.Â  However, it can quickly get out of hand and turn into something that is at best distracting and at worst offensive. What makes Confalone's music so good is that it sounds not like an old country record, but like new music made by people who listen to a lot of great old country records. When his voice rises to a quaver on the bridge of <strong>A-side â€œTrue Loveâ€</strong> (titled sardonically of course) and he belts <em>â€œwell it hurts so bad / just won't go away,â€</em> it shares a common method with country music (simple, somewhat generic lyrics delivered with a force that renders them mysteriously powerful), but it doesn't really sound like country music.\r\n\r\nThe cast of characters on <strong>Tony the Bookie presents...</strong> is a veritable who's who of Boston rock, featuring members and former members of <strong>Drug Rug, Faces on Film, Hallelujah the Hills, Keys to the Streets of Fear, Broken River Prophet</strong>, and <strong>Bane</strong> (yes, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuMhuHrgvQ&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\"> that Bane</a>, but a long time ago), all of them lending their instrumental expertise and raw voices to a wonderfully warm, analog recording done at a Medford studio called The Soul Shop, and resulting in a record that nods back to the expertise of studio musicians in bygone days.Â  The musicianship on these tracks isn't flashy, but the band, composed mainly of <strong>Elio Deluca, Patrick Grenham, Nick Branigan</strong>, and <strong>Eric Provonsil</strong>, with plenty of special guests, hits every song with the looseness of musicians who are completely as home on their instruments and the tightness required to keep everything propulsive and fiery.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œTrue Loveâ€</strong> is a clear single, the poppiest and hookiest of all the songs on the album (which is incidentally available for free at the Bookie <a href=\"http://www.tonythebookie.com/therecord.html\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>). The song takes its time to expand over a simple acoustic guitar progression. Gradually adding coiled drum fills and dreamy slide guitar, yet still making space for <strong>Confalone's</strong> low croon, which always seems to stand on end with secret tensions. The first line is perfectly devastating mood-setter: <em>I woke up all alone in the third year of our love</em>. The ratcheting up of intensity on the aforementioned bridge, after two minutes of verses, is just perfect, with the vocals pouring right out of the keening, dissonant <em>hurts so bad</em> line and right into a high, consonant oooh that leads the song back into the more even keeled melancholy of the verses. Also check out that high pitched yelp in the background of the end of the first ooh, right around 2:43.Â  This is a band of human beings playing their music in a room together, not a sequence of people adding tracks to a disembodied cloud of sound.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œRain Checkâ€</strong> is a nasty, slow-burning 6/8 'fuck you' jam, landing on the more angry side of miserable. It starts with lyrics about blocking out the light coming through the windows and pretty much just gets more pissed off from there. The lyrics on the rising verse lines pour out on top of the time in a way that reminds me strangely of Harry Nilsson, and the recurring <em>â€œI'll take a rain check babyâ€</em> is a perfectly dry put down. The whole song makes a perfect soundtrack for that point in a break up where heartbreak starts to curdle into anger, and I anticipate, the next time I find myself in that situation, getting drunk and howling along with the choruses. The sound of the whole band wailing on those high climaxes on the bridge is enough to send shivers down your spine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tony the Bookie</strong> and company have put together an album that carries on the booze-soaked misery of the best old country music while filling out that archetypal sound with their own inventions and idiosyncrasies. It's the way any music that takes inspiration from older genres (and who doesn't?) should be made, full of respect and love for the old sounds without any boring attempts at emulation. It's people like this who understand that the best homage to the great music of the past is to keep building on it, to make it your own like all those great musicians did themselves.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Rain Check [audio:AEM054 Tony the Bookie Orchestra/02 Rain Check.mp3|titles=Rain Check|artists=Tony the Bookie Orchestra]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - True Love [audio:AEM054 Tony the Bookie Orchestra/01 True Love.mp3|titles=True Love|artists=Tony the Bookie Orchestra]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM054 Tony the Bookie Orchestra.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

There's always a small contingent of people who ignore Ezra Pound's poetry on the grounds that he was a fascist and anti-semite. Many more people, however, approach those poems with an appreciation for their quality despite controversial origins. In this day and age, nobody really fears the artist as a threat to moral codes. Media is exchanged quicker than stolen tourist notes in Barcelona; do you have the energy (or the stupidity) to read into G.G. Allinâ€™s background, only to stop listening to his music once you discover he smeared himself and audience members with his own feces? Fuck that, I say. Letâ€™s celebrate the fearless freaks and worry about their alleged danger to civil society after the partyâ€™s been busted up.\r\n\r\n              Putting our music history caps on for a minute, John Cage more or less had this same covert program of artistic demoralization (or a totalizing spiritual economy of the good which made such judgments pointless in their propping up of  exclusionary categories) all hidden behind a cool screen of Zen and downtown philosophical art happenings. John Cage was a mentor to so many great artists of a variety of media (as well as the partner of the recently deceased choreographer Merce Cunningham) that he singlehandedly made a place for avant-garde American music alongside Cold War prop movements like Abstract Expressionist painting, even going so far as to hock experimental piano techniques on a stupid and short-lived game show. In saying too much, he revolutionized the medium and broke down the flimsy distinctions between pleasant and unpleasant sound, leaving a world of striving experimenters in his wake.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the world of striving experimenters, I recently posed a deceptively simple question on Facebook to see how people would respond. The question was basically this: We speak of musical laws, but who really enforces them? Itâ€™s not hard to eliminate the actual legal mumbo jumbo and see that weâ€™re talking about unspoken laws, almost what Larry David would call â€œthe unwritten rulesâ€ such as tip-toeing around at night. So where do these so called laws of sound claim their authority? As my good buddy Daniel Fishkin (Dandelion Fiction) had the insight to say: \r\n\r\n<em style=\"font-size:9pt;\">â€œSound is fundamentally a physical phenomenon, and its characteristics inform what we do with it. These aren't laws so to speak, but patterns which throughout history music makers and music listeners have found interesting, significant, exciting, holy, sexy, beautiful, or worth fighting for. Unfortunately the academy isn't the only place you'll find people drawing boxes in which to put you. Take Cage, Reich, Eno, Merzbow, and Partch to an uninformed crowd and they'll just call it â€˜modern musicâ€™. Before the rules are taught, they exist merely as practiceâ€”internal structures, obeyed with discipline, love, and devotion by their composers. [Addressing me:] You use Schoenberg as an example [of a modern music rulemaker]. Setting aside his Nationalist streak, all Schoenberg did was devise a system and follow it to its creative consequences. Let the music historians judge the merits of this system, or, let the public decide how listenable its results are. There is never one way; even the most critical and structured musical laws will be found irrelevant in other systems. Serialism and techno are both out of tune by Carnatic standards. In the middle ages, everyone shunned the â€˜diabolus in musicaâ€™, but centuries later composers delighted in its capacity to change keysâ€”and Black Sabbath loved it so much, they didn't even bother modulating. Musical laws are made moot by other laws. Who says parallel fifths sound crude? Who cares if Bach swings?â€</em> \r\n\r\nWell, certainly not me. Besides pointing out the obvious cultural specificity of musical laws, Danielâ€™s essay shows us the most important thing of all: That these rules were made to be broken.\r\n\r\nYou might think all this hocus pocus is a lot of bullshit for an intro to <em>â€œsome folk band.â€</em> But I can assure you that, just because these guys have beards and occasionally tour as members of Akron/Family, just because they grew up friends and collaborators of Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) in Wisconsin, they have the game-changing hybridizing ability of any composer or band currently making music. Whatâ€™s more, they completely demolish the notion of the neatly separated artist and song. With <strong>Megafaun</strong>, the whole spirit of the performance is inextricably bound to the â€œmusical contentâ€. The first time I saw Megafaun play in 2007, they ended their set by leading a sort of evangelical conga-line into the audience. The most jaded of depressed hipsters stopped what they were doing and joined the party. That night, we hung out after the show, getting drunk and singing songs like the National Anthem and Auld Lang Syne. When you hang, you understand. People this warm do what they do as a labor of love, not to be cool media mysteriosos. If you have never before heard their music, I suggest you stop what youâ€™re doing immediately and listen.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œDarkest Hourâ€</strong> from 2009â€™s <strong>Gather, Form & Fly</strong> gives flesh to many of the issues (erâ€¦) fleshed out in this articleâ€™s introductory passages. The song starts out with a concrete collage of water, vehicles, and wind chimes. Suddenly a faucet is dripping. And, um, thereâ€™s a drum circle. It sounds like Gang Gang Dance soundtracking a watersports porno, and itâ€™s fucking brilliant. More concrete sounds fill the soundscape. Hark, through the rain, human voices! Is this O Brother Where Art Thou? Or some shit? <em>â€œI have been wallowing inside the darkest hour,â€</em> they intone with solemn joy. Now the futuristic sonic adventure can begin. Ring modulator on vocals, metallic percussion, a vibrating snare band, in-the-red drumsâ€¦I mean, these guys make the Fiery Furnaces sound like spokespeople for anti-psychotic medication. And why not, letâ€™s end it with a saloon song.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œGather, Form & Flyâ€</strong> reveals the other crucial side of <strong>Megafaun</strong> (well, they really do have an infinite number of sides, but heyhey!â€¦). Pure, slow, heartfelt strings nâ€™ harmonies. Thereâ€™s no mistaking it: These are American boys bred on a slower, more conscientious way of life. You can literally hear the music breathe. The spaces are so pregnant as to render time a meaningless backdrop against which things move and fall in and out of love. When the vocals drop, it is, quite simply, game over. You see why Megafaun are such an underrated dagblasted American band? You see how youâ€™ve been wronged for never hearing their sleepy notes grace your face? Well, reader friend, it gets worse. If youâ€™ve never met them as people, youâ€™re just not as happy as you could be in life. These motherfuckers bomb sorrow like sucker MCs all day. They have literally lifted me out of deep biological depression on more than one occasion. They are literally the nicest people in the world. They are literally some of the best musicians. I have literally said literally seven times in this review. I am writing 1200 words on this band because I believe in them like no other band. Megafaun are the backing band that Will Oldham never had, the Band of the future exceptâ€¦wellâ€¦now. \r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Jake Brunner</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Gather, Form and Fly [audio:AEM055 Megafaun/02 Gather Form and Fly.mp3|titles=Gather, Form and Fly|artists=Megafaun]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Darkest Hour [audio:AEM055 Megafaun/01 Darkest Hour.mp3|titles=Darkest Hour|artists=Megafaun]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear:both; padding-top:20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM055 Megafaun.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Whereas plenty of revivalists seemed perfectly content to disinter long-dead dinosaur jams and repackage them in tight pants, man-machine hybrids everywhere were evolving, reproducing, absorbing influences and creating new ones out of silicone chips and synthesizers. It wasnâ€™t the end of music, but it was the end of a certain idea of music, that it should be played on instruments that needed to be tuned, that the frontman needed pipes like a Basilica organ, that the drummer...hell, even that there <em>be</em> a drummer. Texture was the new guitar solo, attack sustain decay release the new â€œNever Mind the Bollocks.â€ It smelled like...nothing. And sweat and sex and liquor. \r\n\r\n\tThatâ€™s why bands like <strong>Best Hits</strong> are so exciting. Whatever theyâ€™re indebted to stylistically they sound basically influence-less. Even if thatâ€™s an impossible assumption, they at least are trying to sound like nothing ever heard before. Ambient onamonapoeiatic hip-hop? Electro-twee? Whatever, no. I wouldnâ€™t call this music experimental, not because itâ€™s not, but because listening to these tracks doesnâ€™t entail a particularly severe learning curve. Theyâ€™re short and great. Itâ€™s like eating something that looks like a green cube that tastes exactly like bacon and candy. A twosome based out of Brooklyn (<strong>Matt Weiner</strong> on dials and knobs and <strong>Claire Elise Tippins</strong> on more dials and knobs), these guys have a lot of projects going on: the <a href=\"http://peace-age.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">Peace Age label</a>, a whole host of awesome artwork, and bands called Ger, Shrur and Twins. Apart from sounding like the programming lineup of a British childrenâ€™s television network, they all are awesome and well worth checking out. \r\n\r\n\tOnto the 7-inch, we start off with the alternate-dimension club anthem <strong>â€œFantastic Lands,â€</strong> which reminds me of some kind of electrified world-music from a country that doesnâ€™t exist. Itâ€™s the kind of track that makes Diplo-style globetrotting seem positively boring. While MIA is all about universal mash-up bassquaking, these guys pose a compelling counterpoint: like kids hiding under a blanket and calling it the homeworld, <strong>Best Hits</strong> are imagining what it means to be indigenous beat-makers from imaginary places, coining MC-ing languages and extra-geographic rhythm figures for a crossover market. If Mad Decent-style cool-onialism happens to rub you the wrong way, Best Hits throws it down guilt free. \r\n\r\n\t<strong>B-side â€œHeartbeats,â€</strong> on the other hand, sounds slightly more local, almost perversely so, like overhearing a next door neighbor masturbating to exercise videos and pretending to talk to his dead mother on speakerphone. Itâ€™s an interesting channeling of Mr. Roboto-esque autism into awkward dancefloor anthem, almost as if David Byrneâ€™s onstage persona got programmed into a revolting late-80s era Macintosh, or 2001â€™s HAL ended up living inside your beer fridge. Imagine if Grease with a soundtrack by Suicide and youâ€™re half-way there. \r\n\r\n\tI canâ€™t really tell which of these tunes I like better, a feeling that I hope will be exacerbated by the <strong>Best Hits</strong> full-length, out sometime this Winter. Until then, I can just put the two songs on repeat, put on warpaint in my bedroom, and terrify my girlfriend every time she comes home from class. If your New Yearâ€™s resolution is lose your fucking mind, I suggest you do the same. \r\n\r\n\tBut back, briefly, to the idea that I started with, that electronic music breathes in a way almost no other genre can these days. If faced with a decision between the Greatest Hits of Cream and the cream of the <strong>Best Hits</strong> crop, I urge you to relax and let Darwin take control. Put on your headphones, and evolve. \r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Heartbeat [audio:AEM056 Best Hits/02 Heartbeat.mp3|titles=Heartbeat|artists=Best Hits]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Fantastic Lands [audio:AEM056 Best Hits/01 Fantastic Lands.mp3|titles=Fantastic Lands|artists=Best Hits]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM056 Best Hits.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Their music combines an all-out assault on the listener (something that feels a bit like foundering in a choppy, dark sea, which entails not just disorientation and terror at your sudden apparent smallness in the face of the huge ocean but also a kind of life-or-death exhilaration) with a really appealing lack of bells and whistles and an abundance of craft that only someone who has tried to make music like this could easily discern. Sightings, unlike most bands that thrive on extremes of volume and intensity, didn't remake the same album over and over again, but instead expanded their sound in all sorts of unpredictable directions, making music that is both powerful and interesting. Fellow Brooklynites <strong>White Suns</strong>, a trio composed of <strong>Kevin Barry</strong>, <strong>Rick Visser</strong>, and <strong>Dana Matthiessen</strong>, remind me quite a bit of Sightings, and let me assure you that is a terrific thing.\r\n\r\n\t <strong>White Suns</strong> certainly have the volatility of other bands that explore the spaces between rock and noise, combining, as <strong>Matthiessen</strong> told me, the volume and and speed of other heavy rock genres with a dissonance usually more associated with pure art noise. It's not often I hear a band that actually induces a physical reaction, but here I find myself coiling forward in a springy mass of tension and bad posture, my leg jerking arhythmically.  The music the trio makes is so loaded with anti-resolution that it takes a bodily response to dispose of all the tense energy it embeds in my body, especially when it's played loud, and it should be played LOUD.  White Suns, as brutal and blisteringly fiery as their name indicates, play music that has roots, in addition to Sightings, in bands like Hair Police and Japanese conceptual artist The Gerogerigegege who walk the line between straight up art noise and noisy psych rock. There seem to be a lot of astronomy-related names in this area of music (C. Spencer Yeh's Burning Star Core, for example, or <strong>Visser's</strong> solo project <strong>Open Star Cluster</strong>), perhaps the only way of conjuring up something large and powerful enough to reflect not just the music but the physical presence it seems to have in the room.  When it stops, especially at a live show, you can feel the vacuum that it leaves in its absence before ambient sound gradually filters back into the room.\r\n\r\n\t<strong>â€œFlying Dutchman,â€</strong> the A-side, starts with a perfect example of the more aggressive side of <strong>White Suns,</strong> emitting a squall of feedback and then, after a drumstick count in, bursting into a powerful, propulsive storm of unrelenting, fractured guitars that feel like they're tremolo picking right into your brain. The fast, punk-derived drums halt at three intervals to let a rising, five note melody come through before crashing back into time. The shouted vocals (also not without a debt to punk rock) ride the crest of the wave of guitar noise until 1:12, when the meter actually breaks down, and the song, without changing tonally, turns into a dirge-metal stagger that manages to be even heavier than the initial onslaught.  This is where the guitars, which never let up until after that final, sudden acceleration, really feel as if they are smothering you, which evokes that combined terror/exhilaration I mentioned earlier.  \r\n\r\n\tThey can clearly do the power-noise thing, yet <strong>White Suns</strong> aren't a one note act, and they manage to keep a level of formal interest in their music that eludes a lot of acts who only want the visceral reaction and are content to pound into dust the one method they've discovered of evoking it.  This is particularly evident on the B-side of their Ampeater single, the track <strong>â€œGrowth,â€</strong> which achieves its intensity through a more open sound, with the snare and bass drums sliding in and out of phase, growling electronics that sound like processed wind, and the right panned electric guitar reiterating some minor key clusters in a tone that almost sounds like it should be playing some jangly surf melodies. The way the drums slip in and out of a blastbeat for just a moment emphasizes the off-kilter methods of producing tension here.  Whereas on <strong>â€œFlying Dutchmanâ€</strong> the tension comes from straight up volume and speed, here it results from the asymmetry of each element of the song.  We expect the drum pulse at the very least to stay constant, and when it slips out of sync with itself it is severely disorienting.  There is a similar effect in the jangly guitar, which stays very close to that initial chord for almost the entire song, breaking out of repetition and into violent distortion only for very short bursts and only after the halfway point of the track.  This delay gives us the feeling that something is coming, something enormous and terrifying, given the pounding footsteps of the drums, and thus the song is powerful in that it never explodes into catharsis. The Something never arrives, though, and this is the brilliance of the song.  It's far more unsettling than any cathartic climax when you hear the drum footsteps fall back into rim clicks that sound like nothing so much as the amphetamine-hurried ticking of an old alarm clock, and this compositional thinking is what sets the band apart from so many of their peers.\r\n\r\n\tThe diversity and fierce energy expressed in these two tracks alone make <strong>White Suns</strong> worthy of your ears, especially if they've been worn thin by anemic rock bands that get compared to the Arcade Fire.  Allow yourself to be submerged in the sound of a band that actually might make you fear for your life (and enjoy every second of it).\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Growth [audio:AEM057 White Suns/02 Growth.mp3|titles=Growth|artists=White Suns]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Flying Dutchman [audio:AEM057 White Suns/01 Flying Dutchman.mp3|titles=Flying Dutchman|artists=White Suns]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM057 White Suns.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\"><img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" alt=\"Cabinet of Natural Curiosities\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Cabinet-of-Natural-Curiosities.jpg\" width=\"300\" />There's something to be said for sounds and the people who love them.  All musical artists worth a salt love music, they love songs, of course, duh.  But I have a particular fascination for singers, songwriters, bands, orchestral three pieces, xylophone collectives, what have you, that are clearly fascinated with sound itself, as a medium.  And when someone loves sound <em>and </em>songs?  Oh boy.  A songwriter who loves sounds is a potentially powerful musical forceâ€”a person whoâ€™s love for the communication extends to the mode of communication.  The greatest artists are always like this: the best painters have a love for the color and texture beyond the paintings; the best writers, a love for words beyond the story.\r\n\r\n\t<strong>Jasmine Wagner</strong> of Brooklyn/Montanaâ€™s <strong>Cabinet of Natural Curiosities</strong> is exactly this kind of musician.  Quite frankly, sheâ€™s this kind of writer and artist, too.  Wagner, together with fellow sound-conspirator <strong>Alex Wilson</strong> are the items belonging to this curious natural cabinet.  Together their folky tendencies and love of sound create a most serene concoction: 1 part soundscape, 2 parts folk song, all parts lovely.\r\n\r\n\tYou might be quick to call <strong>Cabinet of Natural Curiosities</strong> <em>â€œexperimental folk,â€</em> and you wouldnâ€™t be the first one.  The modifier â€œexperimentalâ€ has quickly become a signifier of the â€œsound loverâ€ state I described above, and in that way it is telling.  However, in an imaginary world where genres werenâ€™t predominantly used as some kind of socio-musical categorization, and merely used as description, Cabinet of Natural Curiosities might just as much be considered experimental electronica.  For even though the foreground sounds are often the acoustic guitar and voice (the folk) I would argue that it's what is in the background that actually makes Cabinet of Natural Curiosities, well, a curiosity.\r\n\r\n\tMany of the songs on the full length <strong>Searchlight Needles</strong> (from which our two Ampeater tracks originate) are very frequently centered inside some kind of noise or atmosphere.  When this is at its peak, on tracks such as <strong>â€œLittle Ice Age,â€</strong> <strong>â€œSun,â€</strong> or <strong>â€œGlass,â€</strong> it feels like the songs are simply sung inside some great weather event or caveâ€”the tracks become oddly geographical for me.  Iâ€™ve been reading â€œThe Ice Palace,â€ by Tarjei Vesaas recently, and I canâ€™t help but picture â€œLittle Ice Ageâ€ (available on their <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/jasminedreamewagner\" target=\"_blank\">myspace</a>) as taking place inside a frozen waterfall.\r\n\r\n\tThe point being, the electronics and noise used by <strong>Cabinet</strong> (Can I call them Cabinet for short?  I canâ€™t help but feel like when pitchfork gives their next LP (tentatively titled â€œButtermilk Channelâ€) an 8.5 and all the Greenwich Village hipsters start listening to them, this is what Iâ€™ll overhear the kids standing outside Tisch smoking cigarettes refer to them asâ€¦) are simultaneously apart from, and integral to, the songs.  This is a wonderful effect and sounds more like Leonard Cohen playing next to Faust inside a subway station than anything else.  Itâ€™s quite splendid.\r\n\r\n\tTurning to the digital single we have on display here, the story is perhaps even more curious.  More so than any of the other tracks on <strong>Searchlight Needles,</strong> I think, <strong>Side-A \"For Sparrow\"/Side-B \"Owllullabyâ€</strong> are songs, not sounds.  Flip to any track on the LP and youâ€™ll know that <strong>Cabinet of Natural Curiosities</strong> loves sounds; but itâ€™s not perhaps until you hear these two songs back to back that you realize just how much love Cabinet of Natural Curiosities has for The Song as well.\r\n\r\n\tTake <strong>A-side â€œFor Sparrowâ€</strong> for instance.  The song centers around <strong>Wagnerâ€™s</strong> voice and strums, filled out by lush sine-wave drips and an insecurely steady organ hum that complete the atmosphere of the track.  But itâ€™s Wagnerâ€™s multi-layered vocals here that lift the song, pushing and pulling it along, finding slow beautiful hooks within this soundscape.  Heck, drop the drips and the organ, and this is simply a folk song with a little bit of bass.\r\n\r\n\tThe last two minutes of <strong>â€œFor Sparrowâ€</strong> give the game up, though, as the song fades away into an ambient sonic collage that maintains and extends the mood of the song like some strange held note.  This <em>â€œdiscursionâ€</em> is nothing new in music, but what is slightly novel is the length of the track devoted to the sounds.  What many bands might limit to 15 or 30 seconds as a â€œcool outro, bro,â€ <strong>Cabinet of Natural Curiosities</strong> let extend into a musical motion with more levity, owning almost a full quarter of the trackâ€™s running time.  I love how the two sections of this track play off each otherâ€”at first listen, the ending is a bit of a surprise.  However, it arises so organically that now I canâ€™t picture the track without it.  This, truly, is a song from lovers of sound, and they integrate the two elements in a way that would make it unruly to separate them.\r\n\r\n\t<strong>B-side â€œOwllullabyâ€</strong> is, if Iâ€™m continuing with this sound/song contrast (thanks for bearing with me, by the way), is all song, baby.  â€œOwllullabyâ€ also not-so-coincidentally functions as the final track on <strong>Searchlight Needles</strong>.  In the movie in my head of this album, this is when the musicians, who have until this point been battling through storms and ice caves and noise monsters, finally emerge into an open field to simply play, only voice, guitar, and some cheerful bells to accompany.  The song is hypnotic, seductive, and really is a lullaby that I will consider singing to my kids, even though they will not be owls.  The acoustic guitar sounds off in never-faltering 1-2-3-1-2-3 while the tiny high bells chirp in to accentuate the dream.\r\n\r\n\tThe transition from <strong>â€œFor Sparrowâ€</strong> to <strong>â€œOwllullabyâ€</strong> actually mimics quite well the effect that the album has on how we perceive â€œOwllullabyâ€ with the swirling last quarter of \"For Sparrow\"'s sonic glory resolving itself into the pleasant and satisfying plucking.  <em>Some of the branches lost their leaves / to show off the owls in the trees. / Some of those owls would agree / you should close your eyes and fall asleep.</em>  Yes, yes you should.  This is music I want to fall asleep and dream to, and any good lover of ambient music (or music with some ambiance) knows that is far from an insult.\r\n\r\n\t<strong>Wagner</strong> remarks that these two tracks fit together as an A-side/B-side because, <em>â€œone is a winter song and one is a summer song. They oppose each other the way the seasons do. Both songs were written and recorded during a cold Montana winter, though <strong>'For Sparrow'</strong> references a hot a smoky summer when the pine forests were burning and the skies of the Missoula valley were yellow and gray, the moon red at night.â€</em>  I have three things to add/note on this.\r\n\r\n\tFirst, I think this is good evidence that beautiful sentences simply tumble out of  <strong>Wagner</strong>, potentially without her even meaning it.  Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ve ever had a better sentence given to me in the body of an email.\r\n\r\n\tSecond, this dichotomy mimics the dichotomy of sounds Iâ€™ve been discussing thatâ€™s present in <strong>Cabinet of Natural Curiosityâ€™s</strong> music, the hot of the human voice and guitar and cold, sterile electronics, or reversed, the hot highs of electronic warblings and the low steady hum of voice and string.  Whichever way Cabinet of Natural Curiosity decides to play it, this contrast is always present in the songs.  To me, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s in the cabinet.  Something summer, and something winter.\r\n\r\n\tThird, I shall add only that both of these songs are about birds.  And when one travels to <strong>Wagnerâ€™s</strong> <a href=\"http://www.songsaboutghosts.com/\">art site</a>, one finds another bird to greet them.  It makes a great deal of sense.  Both of these songs are birds.  Stunning, striking birds.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Rick Andrews</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Owllullaby [audio:AEM058 Cabinet of Natural Curiosities/02 Owllullaby.mp3|titles=Owllullaby|artists=Cabinet of Natural Curiosities]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - For Sparrow [audio:AEM058 Cabinet of Natural Curiosities/01 For Sparrow.mp3|titles=For Sparrow|artists=Cabinet of Natural Curiosities]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM058 Cabinet of Natural Curiosities.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

There are some bushes, some trees, and clusters of flowers scattered about. Several defined paths wind through this garden, but there's plenty of space to forge ahead through the rough. You can enter the garden at any place, but from the entrance it's impossible to see out the other side. The garden is seasonal, and its creations grow, evolve, and die over time. No, this isn't one of those \"Who killed Sean in the garden?\" puzzles; this is an introduction to the mind of <strong>Jerome Ellis</strong>.\r\n\r\nWhen <strong>Ellis</strong> sits down at the piano, or his samplers, or his saxophone, he enters this garden. The creation that then emerges is a musical interpretation of his trajectory through the garden. Each entity that he encounters triggers a motif, complete with suggestions as to tempo, dynamic, and harmonic movement. The path he takes governs the transitions and interactions between these motifs. Sometimes we hear a clean break, sometimes a slow blend of ideas and an eventual distillation to a single dominant figure. As he visits and revisits certain of the garden's residents, we see them grow, blossom, and wither as Ellis's concept of them changes. Some are perennial favorites, and others sprout but once, only to return to dust shortly thereafter. This isn't some quaint metaphor that I've constructed. This is how Jerome Ellis actually makes music. He conceives of it spatially, and while the garden is but one space that he tends to inhabit, it's important to understand this process if we're to preserve a hope of unraveling his unique genius.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ellis</strong> once thought he would grow up to be a great jazz saxophonist, and while he's still got some time before he's considered fully \"grown,\" it looks like he's headed down a much different path. This is the story of how he got set on that path, and where he's going now that he's on it, as spread across a series of digital 7-inch reviews to come in 2010. Those of us who have been trained on a single instrument (particularly in the idioms of classical music or jazz) and chose at one point or another to embark upon an odyssey with a second or third instrument, sometimes feel like we're cheating on a loved one. Why experiment with compositions on piano when I could be engaging in regimented practice on the saxophone? And so it was with Jerome Ellis. Piano was an alluring temptation, but he kept it relegated to second chair, playing only late at night when the sound of his tenor would have woken the household. But these precious hours would prove instrumental to Ellis's musical and intellectual development.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached college, <strong>Ellis</strong> began having second thoughts about jazz as a vocation. He wanted to escape the pitfalls of bebop that so often leave an indelible mark on nascent jazzmen. The brass and bravado of New York jam sessions failed to excite Ellis. Having achieved remarkable technical proficiency at an astoundingly young age, he wasn't moved by solos strung together from bits of Charlie Parker solos, and more importantly, he didn't feel like this is how he was destined to move other people. He began a series of musical experiments with drummer James Monaco, featuring Ellis on keyboards. He suddenly felt as though he were making music of substance, music with the potential to move people on a visceral, and not just intellectual level. James's background was in pop and rock music, a world to which Ellis had significant exposure, but that had never been his focus of study. He began to draw upon his own disparate influences (gospel, blues, classical) and to discover new ones--music from Java, Bali, and Zimbabwe. Ellis remembers thinking, <em>\"I didn't know this was possible, I didn't know sounds could do this, I need this, I need to listen to this, I need to make this part of my life.\"</em> And so it became.\r\n\r\nAmidst these stirring shifts in musical direction, <strong>Ellis </strong>began performing with the Trudy Silver Group at the 5C on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Silver mentored Ellis, encouraging him to synthesize his experiences both in and outside the jazz idiom and to integrate his previous training rather than to abandon it. The result was an intensely personal manifestation of what could loosely be called free jazz, and Ellis began using this semi-regular gig as a venue for testing his new direction, taking tentative walks through the garden of his muse. It didn't take long before he began sharing the group lead with Silver, and not long after that it seemed as though each performance belonged just as much to Ellis's musical vision as Silver's. I was lucky enough to attend several of these sessions, and as I sat on the subway heading back uptown, with the sounds of the evening echoing through my head, on each occasion I knew I had just witnessed something truly special.\r\n\r\nAnd so, we here at Ampeater are honored to present <strong>Jerome Ellis's</strong> first digital 7-inch, entitled <strong>\"Hymnal\" / \"Untitled 1\"</strong>. In 2008 I spoke with Ellis at length regarding this piece, and gained some keen insight on how it came to be. It's not so much a song or a piece or a composition; the best term I can devise to describe it is a \"vessel.\" There are certain fixed elements, but every performance sees these elements reconfigured to address Ellis's increasingly complex musical perspective. <strong>\"Hymnal\"</strong> is always performed in three sections, the first uptempo and rhythmic, the second slow and ambient, and the third ushering a return to the first while echoing the central themes of the piece at large. It's the same cyclical structure that gives closure to the classical sonata form, appropriated here by an orchestra of samples, brought together under Ellis's masterful direction. But <strong>\"Hymnal\" </strong>was and will always be performed live in a single take--there are no overdubs in this recording, and that makes improvisation an essential component in its creation. The saxophone is recorded live atop prepared samples, and while Ellis would seem to be the sole architect of this marvelous and complex construction, the samples that he triggers are also active participants in the piece, tugging it in all directions. Ellis is thus rendered both musician and conductor, positioned at an invisible podium to provide requisite guidance to a dozen or so samples that understand but a handful of basic instructions. The departure in this piece for Ellis is its remarkable accessibility. Very early on in its conception he imposed strict limitations: first, it would have the aforementioned three movement structure; second, all the samples used in the piece would be sacred, and not limited to Western religion or music; third, the melodic contours would be simple, singable, likable. Your average listener typically assumes that artists like Ellis and pieces (OK, vessels) like <strong>\"Hymnal\" </strong>are typically thought to exist for some sort of nonexistent hyper-cerebral music theorist as the sonic equivalent of <strong>Finnegans Wake</strong> or some similarly impenetrable artistic creation. <strong>\"Hymnal\"</strong> is the antidote to this assumption. While its complexities are numerous, they're not expressed as dissonance. This means that listeners are able to relax into the piece and fully grasp its genius without being assailed by tone clusters. When I listen to <strong>\"Hymnal\"</strong> I hear equal parts Mozart, Javanese gamelan, African thumb piano, Ray Charles, and Panda Bear; I hear something completely unique, something that I couldn't have even fathomed to exist before actually hearing it. But most of all, I hear something that moves me, deeply.\r\n\r\nB-side, <strong>\"Untitled 1\" </strong>(I know it's ridiculous to call these \"sides\" on a 7-inch. Even \"digital\" 7-inches can't be 30 minutes long, but to hell with it) represents Ellis's departure into piano music as a serious vehicle for creative expression. This particular path through <strong>Ellis's</strong> garden is the one labeled <em>\"to Brian Eno's house.\"</em> With nothing but a piano, Ellis reminds me how I felt, what I thought, and what I thought music could be, in the moment I first heard <strong>Music for Airports</strong>. It's as though Ellis took a snapshot of time, space, thought, and emotion and upon holding this snapshot up to the light saw tiny holes scattered throughout the picture and then decided to fill them in with sound. One hears this piece and thinks, <em>\"It's exactly what's missing from ______.\"</em> The key is then to fill in that blank, and to recreate as a listener the situation that spawned the creation, in all its minute complexities. If one successfully reunites the two in whatever mental space is reserved for idle thoughts while listening to music, something just clicks and the world ceases to exist as something distinct from the sounds flowing into your ears. Ever tried listening to <strong>Music for Airports</strong> in an actual airport? Go try it, you'll know what I mean.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, this is but an introduction to <strong>Jerome Ellis</strong>--we'll be featuring his music on several 7-inches in the months to come, and while it's tempting to squeeze all my thoughts on his music into a single review, I'll cut it short here in an attempt to create some dramatic suspense. Can you feel it? Good. In the meantime, if <strong>\"Hymnal\"</strong> sent you on as much of a journey as I hope it did (if it didn't, keep listening until it does), you can read the attached interview with Ellis, conducted immediately following the piece's first ever public performance at <a href=\"http://www.wkcr.org\">WKCR 89.9 FM</a> in New York.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n<a href=\"mailto:jje2105@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">Email Jerome Ellis</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/jeromejohnellis\">Visit Jerome Ellis on MySpace</a></p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Read the Ampeater exclusive interview after the jump!</h4>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Untitled 1 [audio:AEM059 Jerome Ellis/02 Untitled 1.mp3|titles=Untitled 1|artists=Jerome Ellis]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Hymnal [audio:AEM059 Jerome Ellis/01 Hymnal.mp3|titles=Hymnal|artists=Jerome Ellis]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM059 Jerome Ellis.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Interview:</h4>\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> So we're here to discuss your latest piece Hymnal, just performed live in the studio today, October 20th, 2008, for the very first time. I thought we'd just get down some preliminary thoughts as to your experience with the piece, your history with it, how it came to be, your experience in New York and elsewhere as a musician that led to this most recent evolution, and how you conceive of it as a whole in terms of the general progress of your artistic development. I know that's a lot to lay on you, but, for starters, what is it? Describe it to people in your own terms.\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> Um, well it's funny calling it a piece, cause it's not written down or anything and it's really loose. I can play it 40 minutes long, 20 minutes long, half an hour. There's a lot of sections, but they're of various lengths, so the pieceâ€¦I call it a piece because I can't call it anything else. It's not a song or an extended song or something, but I don't conceive of it as a concert piece of music that you sit down and just hear for as long as it happens. It's more about filling the room than about being a set length. But it does have 3 movements, so there is a classic structure to it with the first and third being rhythmic and dancey and the second being ambient and slower. That's the way I usually think about it. But the jazz background is in it in different ways. There's nothing really jazzy about it but the looseness and the structure of it comes from that, in that I have melodies that I can throw around and play at various times and I can play off of those however I want to. As opposed to a jazz group where you'll have everybody interacting with each other, I'm interacting with the samples and the loops. Not like a one man band, but like a band comprised of singers from the late 1500s and singers from South American in this big jumbled pot.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> Do you feel like you're improvising when you're performing the piece?\r\n\r\n<strong>JE: </strong>When I'm moving through it, no. Each section is planned out, but within the sections I'm improvising. As a whole it's very structured, which is different from what I've done in the past, especially on saxophone.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH: </strong>So you conceive of yourself primarily as a saxophonist. What has it been like to branch out from saxophone to other instruments, to then moving past other instruments and just focusing on the nature of the sound itself? Are you thinking of yourself less and less and less as a saxophonist, or are you thinking of yourself as a tenor sax player on vacation.\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> Less of a saxophonist, definitely going in that direction. When I started playing with my friend James Monaco, my dearest friend in the world, last summer, it was him on drums and me on saxophone for a little bit. We tried something like that and it didn't work out. I've always been toying around with keyboards and pianos, so I had brought my keyboard over to his house and started to play a little bit. That fit. So I began immediately to think of things in terms away from saxophone. When I was playing saxophone a lot and I wanted to be a jazz saxophonist, that was the path I wanted to go on and I would listen to lots and lots of saxophonists. It would hinder my piano playing. When I would play piano I would feel bad that I wasn't practicing saxophone, so it would usually happen late at night or something. I kinda stifled that a little bit, but when I started playing with James I opened up a lot more and realized that I could branch out. It's been like that since I came to college; less of a saxophone player, more of a composer, I guess you could say--it's a weird word for me. Just, exploring. Exploring lots of different things, because I realized that there are certain people whose voice rests solely inside the saxophone, and that's all they need to do. Just as there are people who sing and play piano, and that's all that they do. But I realized that's not what I need. I feel much more of an affinity to the piano, actually, which is strange since I've never had any training on it. So there's a lots of things that I used to try to stifle that now I'm welcoming.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> So as you added these instruments, it seems like it took you further and further away from jazz. Now this might be a little bit of a difficult question so feel free to blow me off if you need to, but do you feel like jazz is anachronistic? Did it feel in some ways old fashioned, like you were playing in an idiom that wasn't really going anywhere, like you were playing things past, and that playing Coltrane was somehow not moving forward.\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> Yeah, I think I had that feeling. It was an uncomfortable feeling, but I think there's value in peopleâ€¦I don't think jazz is dead or will die or that people who focus on jazz are somehow not moving forward. That has crossed my mind, and I think a lot of people feel that way, but I don't feel that way. I played in an ensemble in the fall, and I didn't feel that I was really saying what I wanted to say. I realized that jazz was a dialect, the same way that rock is a dialect and folk is a dialect, and I realized that I wasn't really speaking in that dialect. I would bring a lot of these little things into my improvisation that wouldn't fit into this straight-ahead bop tradition and I would get scolded for it. I began to realize that maybe that's not how I should play, that maybe it's not the truest way for me. So I don't think jazz is dead and I don't think people who play it are following a dead dialect. It's possible to be really stale in jazz with lots of hard bop, but it's also possible to keep it fresh and vital.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> Is the bridge between Hymnal and the more traditional bop that you were playing your work with the Trudy Silver group? Do you see that moving in conjunction with the more progressive direction that you're taking, or is that your remaining anchor to the jazz tradition? Because you are doing composition in that, and you've mentioned that you're taking more and more of a lead role in terms of the creative direction of that group, has that facilitated in this, has it served as a stepping stone to where you are now? Are you still feeling very much part of that or have you now moved beyond it?\r\n\r\n<strong>JE: </strong>No, I do certainly feel part of it. I don't think I'll move on for quite a while. I've learned a lot playing with Trudy, because when I'm doing free jazz I can bring in these little things that I do that aren't in this bop tradition. I can do these saxophone river lines all up and down the instrument and all on a five note pattern. I hardly ever swing when I'm playing in that group, and she doesn't either. When you have free jazz in that domain there's a lot more room to venture out into other places, and yeah, I have been trying out many different compositional ideas there, both on piano and on saxophone, which has been really good, because she's very open to all that. It's helped me with Hymnal, especially when you begin to manage all these different elements. When we played in that 5-piece with bass and tuba and drums, it would often fall to me to manage everything that was going on. So when I mention that I have this band of samples, I've learned a lot from playing with her about the way you control them. I guess it's both, it's a stepping stone but I'm also very much in it. I don't see it as just a thing I'll leap off of and then leave.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> For folks who aren't quite as familiar with the logistics of working with samples, my understanding of it is that in a sense you have complete control over them, but in another sense you're very much working with them and constantly struggling against them to get them to do what you want. The relationship between working with samples as a band and actually working with real band members is a closer connection than you might assume.\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> Yeah, it's really strange. James and I learned a lot about sampling from Dilla, the late Dilla, who is just so good at the art of sampling. We've torn apart the album \"Donuts\" and there's lots of different things like, well it's just him, he doesn't have any people on the record rapping or anything, so he treats samples as humans, he'll interact with them, he'll leave space where you hear the person breathing. It's a lot of fine work on a sample to get it right, because on a hardware sampler it's important to get it to where when you press a pad and it sounds just the way you want it, so there's a lot of chopping up a sample, getting it to stop and start in the right spots, volume issues, balance issues, so it's like being the leader of a group, handling the way people are playing with each other. You might have one person play quieter, or have one person fulfill a set role. There's 10 samples in Hymnal, so for example there's three in the 1st movement. There's the bottom loop, with the singers [sings] so you have that, and their role is to be the rhythmic ground on top of which everything else will build, so they have a very set role. Then there are the two other ones. There's one of a men's chorus singing and one of just a lady, and those will come in and out. Their role is more surface level, and you have different roles. In the 2nd movement there's a sample from a spiritual, the way the man ends the song and then the clapping afterwards. So that's more of an ambient side thing, and then you have this organ sample from the 1600s. That's a loop that goes over and over again and that's also rhythmic in its way. You have to assign different roles to various samples as you would in a jazz group. Where the bass may in one part be a walking baseline, and in another part may be freer.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> As someone who was working with a single instrument, a saxophone, how did you build your arsenal, how did you select what instruments were absolutely necessary to creating the sound that you have, and what sound do you think you've achieved with the samples and instruments that you've picked?\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> Well the thing that's interesting about sampling, is that once you have a sampler the entire world of sound is suddenly available to you. It's awesome and also crazy, how much you can grab and tweak. So it comes pretty necessary early on to limit things, to put boundaries all over the place. There are several boundaries in this. One was that all the samples would be sacred music. A focus in Hymnal is sacred music, and how people from all over the place get into this state of worship or praise or even just losing it. In the 1st movement, the loop that goes over the whole thing, that lays the foundation is from South America. It's praise music for their gods, and the same thing with the loop in the 3rd movement. The two other ones in the 1st movement are from Java. There's one of a men's chorus from Java and the other of a lady and that's also sacred music. If you hear the word Hymnal you automatically think of something rooted in a religion from the West, because the Hymnal I have that my Mom gave me is staunchly hymns from the Baptist line, so I was interested in using not just that religion but going further. So in the second movement you get these samples from the Renaissance and then one from a modern hymn being sung. In the third movement we return to the ones from South America and we have these different pieces of sacred music from all over the world. It's helpful to have these limits, because if I wanted to sample something and it wasn't sacred then I would just be like no, I can't use that. So it begins to focus the piece. It's the same way if you have a band made up of similarly minded people, then you'll have a certain sound. I think maybe that was also what I was going for, putting my saxophone and pitting it with and against people (a lot of the samples are of voices), pitting them against each other but all kinda directed towards the same place. The saxophone is used in a different way; there are two different ways that it's used, both very far away from how it's usually used in jazz. One is for chords and for drones that I have throughout. Actually, I have a little name for them, I call them clouds. The process is just looping the saxophone, but I fade or ease into the notes so it sounds like one long drone. That's one role of the loops that I use with microphones. So you can get a saxophone chord, some sound dreamy, some sound brutal, some throbbing, but that presence of many different saxophones in layers runs throughout. Then there's also the process of the saxophone as a rhythmic instrument, which maybe fulfills the role of a bass, as in the first and third movements when you have these pounding saxophone notes throughout and then you have these chords stacked on top there. I actually realized after I began the piece that I was listening to a lot of R&amp;B from the 60s and 50s--Ray Charles, The Cardinals, Joe Turner, and I listened a lot to the way the saxophone's used in R&amp;B. It's very different. You take a saxophone player from a 1960 R&amp;B group and then you take one in a jazz group and they're so far apart. The saxophone player in the R&amp;B group acts just as another voice, the lines he plays are simple, they're singable, bluesy, but you don't really get a R&amp;B saxophonist playing quickly, his parts are more shouts. So I began to be interested in how the saxophone was working in that context. All the saxophone melodies in the piece are closer to that than they are to a line from bop.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> In that sense, as soon as you started playing, it immediately reminded me of something that Don Cherry or Albert Ayler would do, taking melodies from childrens songs and turning them into very freeform jazz, and Don Cherry taking influences from the orient, those were very simple melodic figures that they turned into these great epic opuses, and that seems to be what you're doing here. Is it also a comment that you seemed to have moved beyond technique? As we're talking about you moving beyond jazz, really at the core of bebop, (and it's not really an arguable point) that part of bebop is the display of virtuosity. Are you trying to show, instead of virtuosity, a sense of spirituality? You were talking about using only sacred samples, well in a sense if you're using all sacred samples and yourself as one of those samples, repeated and dubbed, is this your Love Supreme? Is this a display of your own spirituality, drawing back from the pompousness and the show of bebop virtuosity and just simplifying everything.\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> That's exactly right. Especially last year when I would go to jazz clubs and jam, I would get really frustrated and tired of saxophone players. There would be a line of six of 'em and they would all go up and just play really quickly and really loudly. It can be very moving if you're very good at that, but I've since changed my goals. I've done that, I've moved people by technique. Saxophone players don't like to admit this, but it's really easy to play quickly and loudly. It's the nature of the instrument. I wanted to shift the focus away from moving people from saying \"Wow he's really good at saxophone\" to a different kind of appreciation. I've done that, I get really bored really easily. I got this sampler nine months ago, and it's already central to what I'm doing. I work really slowly and I move quickly in a sense and I drop things really easily, which is sometimes a bad habit. I began to get frustrated with simply having people be like \"Wow, you're really good at saxophone\" or \"Wow you play really quickly\" so yeah, I wanted to pare down the technique. It's not a hard saxophone part to play. The melody's all quarter notes and half notes, and I think that's important. I think there's kinda a thing with pop melodies in there, and how pop music's focus isn't on technique. The value lies somewhere else. When a person can sing something, that's valuable, and you don't really hear people singing bebop lines. I mean, some people. Not many. I think that's what I was going for as well. And that was part of the R&amp;B thing, like I can sing the Fathead Newman solos from Ray Charles songs because it's just as if he's another voice in the band. Part of it came out of the fact that I simply don't have the technique that I used to. I don't really want to. I don't practice saxophone as much as I did, I write more and I write with different sounds more. So I don't really have that technique anymore, and I'm fine with that. My focus has moved on from there. That's not saying that technique isn't important, obviously. I'll never be a saxophone guy, and I don't want to. I used to, but that changed.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> Why did that change, and when?\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> James had a big influence in this. When I started listening more widely, I started listening to a lot of music from Java and Bali and Africa, Zimbabwe and a lot more pop music. I realized a lot of it was closer to how I wanted to move people. I think people get tired of having to appreciate something for its technique or showiness. I think a lot of people do dig that, which is why a lot of people still like bebop. People like solos, seeing a guy who can solo really well on guitar, but when I listen to people like Deerhunter, nobody ever solos. They move me through different means. It's like finding a different way to impress people, and impress in the sense not of to \"wow\" them, but impress in the sense of to make a mark on them. So they'll move me through the way they layer things and not through the way they solo. I think that's valuable and often can be harder to do. I think I like to take on challenges a lot and maybe because I get bored. So I made that a challenge for myself, how would I approach making something meaningful and not make the focus the saxophone and the way I'm playing saxophone.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH: </strong>I mentioned briefly the issue of spirituality as involved in the piece. What does this personally mean to you, having moved past technique, and trying to reach audiences with a pop sensibility, you were talking around the issue of really hitting at this interior of a person, trying to touch them on a level that's not relying on some sort of intellectual processing and really hitting at some emotional core. Yes, it has something to do with being able to hum a tune, and yes it has something to do with the overall simplicity and catchiness of the music--it has beat, it has rhythm, it's not overly complex--but do you think that using spiritual samples and having a sense of spirituality yourself, that this is the primary message you're trying to convey and maybe the primary way in which you're trying to impact your audience directly?\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> I think that all music's purpose is to take one higher, and depending on the person and the music is very variable, and I think that we all like to leave for a while. Why it's weird to think of Hymnal as a composition is that I get really frustrated with a lot of modern classical composition that only connects with the mind. It's almost like someone telling you \"sit there and take this\". It's supposed to be good for you even though your mind won't grasp it, or maybe it's only your mind that grasps it. You can come away with a great feeling, or you can come away feeling empty. I didn't want that, I wanted to hit on various levels. The interior is important, the spiritual aspect about going higher to someplace. Music can take you away to many places, but the specific direction of up is what I want. Loops have an interesting part in that, because there's always this element of trance in the way Hymnal is built, because trance is another way that people around the world go higher. That's where I wanted to take off from. I listen to tons of music from Java and Bali and the Javanese especially, there's such a sense of circularity. I played with that in Hymnal--the way it ends is very similar to the way it begins. And of course loops are little circles in and of themselves. The whole way it moves within a set place but finding rest inside of that, the second movement hits at that the most. The second movement is the loosest. Every time I play it it's a little bit different, and I wanted that, I wanted to react to the various things I'm playing. So you have these two saxophone notes going in and out of each other. You have this man singing in the background this same note, going over and over again, and you start to get into this place. When you see people in a church service and they're taken back by the spirit, all they'll do is sway and hum. I love seeing that and I love being there. You can only focus on so much in a piece of music, both as the performance and as the audience.Â  There's like 4 chords in the entire thing, there's not an emphasis on harmony at all, there's not an emphasis on harmonic movement. The first movement eventually has two chords and for most of it it's just one with drone. The second movement has maybe one. The third movement has two as well. When you take the focus away from the harmony, away from the technique, you start to be able to focus on other things like the melody and the way you get swept up. It's very much about the room, very much about things ringing and swirling about. I think that in having this so open, because I need a lot of space when I'm making things happen in the air, when you have something that doesn't have a certain genre with it, you can't say oh that's jazz or, because it's kind of electronic but not really, when you have this open feel to it you can start to focus on what you're saying about the spirit. But I didn't want it to be heavy-handed, which is why rhythm is there. I could just make the whole thing the second movement for half an hour, and that would be fine with someone maybe, but the rhythm and the dance helps to raise that up and lighten it a little bit. It's really about the listener. I think that's another thing I was frustrated with about classical music and often with jazz, people seem to forget the listener. The performers and the composers will treat the listener like someone who has to sit there and take it. Going back to pop music, pop music can't survive without the listener, the audience, and what the person wants. So I began to care a lot about what the person wants, and of course not everyone gets really excited about drones or loops, but I think having things like clear melodies makes it more welcoming to people. That's what I think about gospel. You don't go to church for a concert (well, some people will), but gospel music from the beginning wasn't about the concert or the musical object. It's all about people, singing. It's not about the stage or the person on the stage high above the audience. I wanted it to be welcoming to people, for people to feel free to sway and not have it be this cold thing. It's called Hymnal, but I purposely didn't put any hymns in it. I wanted to approach the way gospel music affects people through means that aren't hymns or songs.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> Are you telling a story, do you see a plot, do you see a greater structure? Are you trying to convey something in an arch across the entire piece? Are you taking people from point A and dropping them off at point B, or are you doing that in a smaller form, within each movement?\r\n\r\n<strong>JE: </strong>Well there are two different strands here that I'm playing with, The first is the classical structure, because the classical structure of fast slow fast mirrors the classical structure of 1-5-1, and the whole concept of home-away-home. And that's how classical music has told its stories for a long time. The sense of being home, being in a place, going somewhere and coming back, is the most basic story of a journey. Because a journey really isn't a journey until you somehow arrive back home or in a state that is stable. So you have this strand going in there, but then what I was talking about with this music from Java. It's interesting hearing this music with my ears, because they're Western, and they're used to this. I don't know how people in Java hear, maybe they hear stories in their music, but I don't hear stories in Javanese music. I hear big circles. I hear just one state of rest. A key thing of classical structure is the notion of tension and being resolved. There's not a whole lot of tension in Hymnal. The saxophone clouds are pretty consonant, but sometimes I'll insert half steps above or below to give them a different sound. But the second movement was pretty overall serene. Some people may hear the clapping noises as some tension there, but what I was playing with was trying to reconcile this circular feeling which I don't feel has much of a story, and I'm fine with that. I really value the notion of rest in music. From what I've noticed in learning so much about classical music is that a key difference between German and French classical music is that German classical music is much more linear--Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn. But French classical music--Ravel, Faure--is much more circular much more surrounding. When you listen to Mozart you hear section then cadence then a new section then cadence. It moves very logically, which is why so many studies say that Mozart can help your brain, because it's a logic that you're following. Whereas in French music it's more static in a sense, but so many new things can happen when something is static, like modal jazz is a parallel. When you have a song like So What that only uses two modes, you can go places you can't go when you have chords every other beat. So story telling in modal jazz is a lot different than storytelling in bebop. As far as Hymnal having an overall story, I don't really think it does. I think the melodies that we've heard throughout culminate in the third movement, so in a sense it's a journey to that point. But I didn't really conceive it in a linear fashion like that and not even within the movements. Especially the second movement, I wanted it like a bath where things wash over you. You're not necessarily saying, \"here's the third section of the second movement,\" but rather \"here's where the story rests.\" I really value rest in music and peace, because I don't have enough of it outside the music. I often see music as a refuge. I love finding nap records, things I'll put on only to surround me and help me sleep. It's kinda the ambient conception, how Brian Eno sees music. People will often devalue ambient music, they'll say it has no direction. But I think there's a lot of value in that.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> When someone learns how to read, it becomes very difficult if not impossible to unread. You look at a sign, you understand immediately what it says. When someone has a certain level of musical training either as a performer or as a listener, it becomes very difficult to not grapple with music on the level in which you were trained. If someone has perfect pitch, it's difficult to not hear a C, if someone has relative pitch it's difficult to turn that off. Is part of what you're doing with this idea of a sonic wash, trying to take people who have an innate sense of musical structure and a set of expectation for it, and trying to teach us how to unread, or unlisten, to allow the music to flow over us in a way that isn't possible in a lot of musical settings.\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> That's absolutely right. When I stumbled upon this music from Java, this is for me what I'm most obsessed with. I listen to it every day. I didn't know how to interpret it. The music is put together in a different way than it is in the West, it's viewed a different way than it is in the West. I became interested in taking these sounds and the way these things would react with me and trying to mimic those, but not trying to sound like I was making music in that tradition. That's futile, I didn't grow up with a Javanese background. When people are exposed to things like that, it's really valuable, because some people need it. The first saxophone player I ever fell in love with was Dexter Gordon. At that time I needed Dexter Gordon, and everything that he did, that room filling tone, his simplicityâ€¦some people need certain things at certain points. When I found this music from Java, I realized that it was what I needed. It's interesting when you find out that you need something, post finding it. I think that some people like lots of music and then they stumble on something and think \"I didn't know this was possible, I didn't know sounds could do this, I need this, I need to listen to this, I need to make this part of my life.\" That's happened to me with music from Java and then thumb piano music from Zimbabwe. The same thing, absolutely magical and like nothing else made in the West. It is in a sense a process of unlearning because you have to get used to this thing you've never heard, but it can be healthy. Exposing people to that is another goal of mine.\r\n\r\n<strong>BH:</strong> Do you have a sense of where you need to go from here, or are you living in the moment, everything's perfect, this is the furthest point of your mental musical development and you're just gonna see where it goes from here, or do you already have an idea of things that need to change, things that need to grow, things that need to expand, are you going to move more towards drone or more towards use of keyboards in this whole project? Where do you see yourself going and are you already thinking ahead?\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> I'm always thinking ahead. It's very exhausting doing that, I get really tired thinking about it. That's another reason why I can't really call it a piece. It's never gonna be finished and it's never gonna be static. In a month, Hymnal's gonna be different. It's more of a vessel to pour things into. It's not like it's sealed up or set aside. Which is why I'll never be able to be a composer and publish things. I can never put periods on things and say \"OK, that's the way Hymnal is.\" Although the structure will remain, when I learn things I put them into it.  A piano piece I wrote last October is now much different. I think eventually I'll find the state I need to be in and live in that for a long time. This is not it. It's a good step and it's a hard step that I've taken, but I'm definitely thinking ahead. I have to do a composition for a class I'm in, and I have to write this down for chamber ensemble, which will be the first time I've written anything down. I have tons of little sheets of paper that I've tried to write piano pieces down. I get to measure 6 and just stop. What if I want to play measure 4 three times? This is another step.\r\n\r\n<strong>JE:</strong> Something I was thinking about a lot during the summertime, when I wasn't doing free jazz, when I was improvising with James--We were working with specific songs, composing and structuring, and I realized that with jazz and not just free jazz there's what I call a ceiling. It depends on the players, it depends on the interaction, it depends on how people know each other, but there's kinda a ceiling and it's very hard to go past it. You can get really intense and really emotional and you can take people places, but eventually it has to hit the ceiling becauseâ€¦composition has many benefits. When something is composed like a novel or a short story is, the way these more concrete forms move people, you can do in a composition but you can't necessary do in jazz. Motifs that come back in and out, and structure itself, these can be moving. I was interested in composing this and having a lot of structure to where I could extend the ceiling. When you're improvising with people there's only so much you can say because a lot of it's not predetermined, which applies more to free jazz. When you play standards you have a common ground, so when you play Misty there's the entire history of how that entire song has been performed and depending on how much you know about it you can take part in all that's happened before you, so the ceiling goes away there. But with free jazz you can go to really great places but there are some places you can't go to because of the lack of compositional structure. I'm not saying it's impossible to structure free jazz, as Braxton will show you....There are so many details that I've never had to deal with, with the electronics now, there's so much weight on me when I play with this setup because there's so much that could go wrong, but there's so much more that could happen. The more you have going on the more you're capable of doing and the more you're prone to fail. Fail's not really applicable in music. The more it can fall off. But when everything works together in conjunction it hits. It's not like hitting your mind, it's not like you grasping this, it hits you, emotionally, physically, and that's what the rhythm is for, that's what the dreaminess is for. When all that works in conjunction it hits. It's hard to make it hit, but that's what makes it all the more exciting, when something is achieved that's really hard. I never got nervous when I was playing jazz, because there's such a focus in the moment that there's not much pre-moment work. You'll have a setlist, you'll rehearse things, but it really is all about the interaction. With this it's both, there's so much pre-work and then you have to do it, and that's really taxing. It's interesting, because composers when they write for ensembles, I'm sure they feel nervous in the audience listening, but they can't really do anything, and even if they're conducting their compositions there's only so much they can do. But when you are the only one who this depends on and the people, the samples, the samples ARE people, but the people aren't gonna do anything. You have to press a button and have them come to life. When it's all on you, you're the only one who can make it hit. Of course there's the importance of people in the room, people taking part, but it's just that that weight makes it harder to hit and makes it more exciting when it happens. It's a weird composer-performer role that I'm exploring, and happy with.\r\n\r\n</div>",

Look at her press photo: What crazy hair! Why is she dressed like a Google employee? Is that shit under her eye? That Weird Girl isnâ€™t the girl who stuffed rolls into her sweatpants at lunch in middle school. That Weird Girl isnâ€™t the lady who walks around your neighborhood with a block of wood tied to her arm that she checks periodically like a watch. Those are just weird girls.\r\n\r\nThat Weird Girl, on the other hand, is beautiful but damaged (but not in any way that would leave her dysfunctionally insane), neurotic but relatable (just like you!), a hard drinker (no pussy drinks), plays the guitar (or OK, the piano). Of course, the fact that That Weird Girl scans like a grocery list of every rock nerdâ€™s masturbation scenarios is definitely some kind of dead giveaway.\r\n\r\nStill, the question is less one of authenticity than it is one of attachment. Why do we always, for lack of a better word, believe, in That Weird Girl? No one questions if the guys in Bon Jovi walk around Walgreens in leather pants and cowboy shirts (I mean, they probably do). But embedded within the iconography of That Weird Girl is a presupposition of truthfulness, a pact between listener and artist that says <em>â€œDonâ€™t lie to me.â€</em> From then on out, every affectationâ€”from smoking in bed to rolling your râ€™s to dressing like an lumberjackâ€”becomes an example of individual quirkiness. From Grace Slick to Betty Davis to Bikini Kill to Courtney Love to Missy Elliot to Regina Spector to Amy Winehouse to Lady Gaga...these weird girls bank their careers not just on their music, but on a carefully crafted larger-than-true-to-life-ness that both exceeds our expectations and matches them perfectly.\r\n\r\nI know I havenâ€™t talked much about music yet, but thatâ€™s about to change. I mentioned at the beginning of this review that <strong>Ivana XL</strong> is a subversion of the That Weird Girl, something she accomplishes both on the level of pose and product. Take the name, the Donald Trump-ian opposite of slacker wet-dreaminess, to account for the latter. Sounding like a cross between some kind of Soviet super-secret agent and a Powerpoint presentation, Ivana XL recognizes the simultaneous irony and sexiness in what amounts to overselling oneself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, consider the record: These arrangements, consisting mostly of piano, acoustic guitars, <strong>Ivanaâ€™s</strong> voice and a fuck-ton of reverb, sound like they were laid down in a zero-gravity chamber with all the instruments floating around, banging into one another, bunching up in the corners. The effect strikes an odd balance between intimacy and coldness, like someone telling you about her childhood over hot cocoa spiked with poison. If That Weird Girls are all about trust, then Ivana XL is about only letting you get so close before stepping back into the infinite spaciousness of her music, substituting one of her overdubbed voices for another, coolly multiplying personalities behind a beat-up saloon-style keyboard.\r\n\r\nThe first track <strong>â€œHappy Birthdayâ€</strong> might be a human transcription of a music box melody, stop-starting sweet verses in order to let some terrifying overtones carry over the bar-line. Itâ€™s like the hallucinated soundtrack to a film version of Alice in Wonderland animated entirely in crayon and cutouts from strangers wedding photographs. I canâ€™t get a handle on the creepiness here, but itâ€™s definitely there, lurking inside the arpeggios like the older-gentleman next-door-neighbor whoâ€™s always inviting kids over to earn a couple extra bucks doing yard work or polishing his car or whatever. Suburban mythology, danger in the land of circle driveways and gazebos: this is the toxic subtext of the tune, a birthday salutation hissed by a bag lady through the tracheotomy hole in her throat.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Ex Oh,â€</strong> has a similarly shaky relationship to fact, fiction and nightmare, fitting chamber-pop hookiness, folksy guitar pulls and a big drumkit crescendo into a three-minute super-8 home movie, the film crackling, the lens flare obscuring your own face in all the family shots. The sound is intensely personal in the vaguest way possible, somehow culling up everyone and no oneâ€™s half-remembered childhood summers, kids you kind of knew drowning in creeks, years and years of life condensed into a drunken bathroom stall remembrance some twenty years down the line. How these songs were written I donâ€™t know, but these are some of the chanciest, scariest slow jams I know.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ivana XL</strong>, like a scholar of weird girls everywhere, has pulled the camera back on the singer-songwriter fakebook, the real that is somehow less real than the fakes it helped produce.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Ex Oh [audio:AEM060 Ivana XL/02 Ex Oh.mp3|titles=Ex Oh|artists=Ivana XL]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Happy Birthday [audio:AEM060 Ivana XL/01 Happy Birthday.mp3|titles=Happy Birthday|artists=Ivana XL]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM060 Ivana XL.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

With an impressive knowledge and appreciation of local indie/experimental music, they've managed to integrate themselves into the scene remarkably quickly.Â  Moreover, although all 3 members of True Womanhood are only 23 years old, they've known each other since middle school and it shows in the comfort with which they blend influences and support each others' crazy ideas.Â  The chemistry is all there.\r\n\r\nOf <strong>A-Side \"The Monk\",</strong> percussionist <strong>Noam Elsner</strong> remarks, <em>â€œthis is a song we originally recorded for our demo and re-recorded for this release. It's an interesting song for us because both times we recorded it it ended up changing drastically during the process. So you could say it's been a really long song writing process, even though the main structure of the song hasn't been touched since we first started playing.â€</em> The latest version was recorded at Death By Audio in DC and mixed with the help of J. Robbins.Â  <em>â€œWhen we got into J's studio we realized he had all this amazing equipment like an awesome Charter Oak mike and some sweet plate reverbs that we put all over the song so we redid the vocals and put reverb and tape echo on a bunch of the sounds, we play this song with a timpani that has a piece of metal sitting on it, you could call it prepared timpani if you're into Cage and that sort of thing, but it made the timpani sound all sorts of fucked up which was awesome and we tried to bring those sorts of weirder sounds out with the reverb plate.â€</em> Texturally, it's fascinating.Â  Although the skeleton of the song is fairly conventional, it's fleshed out provocatively.Â  The \"weirder sounds\" that Elsner speaks of give the song an ethereal quality which is haunting in places.Â  Lush reverb on innumerable guitars is offset by violent crashes on the \"prepared timpani.\"\r\n\r\nThe band reasons, <em>â€œthis is kind of a funny song because it's one of our most straightforward poppy songs which was why we wanted to temper some of that with some stranger sounds, so like the Phil Spector breakdowns in the chorus got that treatment and hopefully we reached a happy medium between pop and experimental.â€ </em> That they certainly do.Â  <strong>â€œThe Monkâ€</strong> exhibits traces of pop, particularly in its structure and in the pre-chorus, where a catchy rising chord progression builds beneath falsetto laced vocals.Â  <em>â€œI'll meet you halfway...â€ </em> But pop isn't a word that would come to the minds to most listeners.Â  <strong>\"The Monk\"</strong> is a lot more accessible than, to draw on the John Cage reference, 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence, but honestly I'm quite thankful for that.Â  It's about as conventional as the kind of 'pop' put out by the likes of Radiohead or Bjork.\r\n\r\nActually,Â <strong>True Womanhood</strong> gets a lot of comparisons to Radiohead and also to Sonic Youth.Â  While the basis for such comparisons is fairly obvious, the band is a little uncomfortable whenever theyâ€™re drawn.Â  During an interview with DCist, guitarist/vocalistÂ <strong>Thomas Redmond</strong> explained,Â <em>â€œI feel that is just convenience. Thatâ€™s all it is. What those two bands do is they mix crazy avant garde stuff with pop stuff.Â  And letâ€™s be honest, thatâ€™s what weâ€™re trying to doâ€¦ But I think whatâ€™s really important to us is the new music thatâ€™s coming out now. Weâ€™d be more comfortable with a No Age and Beach House comparison. Or HEALTH and Beach House. Or No Age and Slow Diveâ€¦â€ </em>Itâ€™s in moments like these that True Womanhoodâ€™s knowledge and appreciation of music really becomes obvious.Â  Actually, they make it clear that theyâ€™re influenced by just about everything under the sun.Â  BassistÂ <strong>Melissa Beattie</strong> points out,Â <em>â€œweâ€™ve listened to a lot of hip hop lately.â€</em>And sure enough, the bandâ€™s MySpace page ironically (or not?) states,Â <em>â€œTrue Womanhood is the best rapper alive.â€</em> A full text of that interview can be found atÂ <a href=\"http://dcist.com/2009/01/three_stars_true_womanhood.php\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nWith regard to <strong>\"The Monk,\"</strong> <strong>Elsner </strong>concludes, <em>â€œIt's also probably our happiest song, we don't really do too much in happy moods so even when we do it still ends with the line 'we tried and failed.' make of that what you will.â€</em> Well, to me it's not the ultimate but the penultimate line that haunts the most, <em>â€œwe eat our young.â€</em> Cheerful indeed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Elsner</strong> describes <strong>B-Side \"Shadow People\"</strong> as an enigma.Â  <em>â€œIt's probably the oldest song that we still play and since day one it's been a fan favourite. It's been around since way before we even had a demo but it wasn't on the demo, and we got all these people asking where it was.â€</em> But he modestly asserts that the only â€œsolid partsâ€ are the guitar riff and drum track.Â  Beattie typically plays the drum track on the Vox Percussion King, a vintage drum machine that the band tells me has only ever been used on one other recording, Kraftwerk's Autobahn.Â  So <strong>True Womanhood</strong> has a lot to live up to.Â  After all, Autobahn shattered barriers as one of the first commercially successful electronic music recordings.Â  But Beattie's use of the Vox Percussion King is actually a lot more interesting than Kraftwerk's.Â  A heavy guitar riff holds the song together, leaving the drums free to wander outside the lines.Â  Thunderous crashes and hits free to fall at moments when they might not be expected.Â  Also, as Elsner is quick to point out, <em>â€œIt's got amazing sounds but it's really old skool, you have to play all the sounds by hand with these weird paddle things.â€</em> Basically, it's a spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe band explains that <em>â€œfor such a simple song, we've gone through a million ways of playing the song live, including the use of an electric guitar bowed with an acoustic, and also an installation we set up with a ton of organ pipes with mics fit inside which all ran into a mixer and some crazy effects.. So when we wanted to record there were so many options we sort of did not know the best way to fit them all together, and we went through many different variations before settling on this version. The recording features Thomas singing into some of the organ pipes and also I believe includes the use of every single Death by Audio pedal.â€</em> That's right.Â  <strong>\"Shadow People\"</strong> might be a simple song but texturally, it'sÂ  thick as fuck.Â  This becomes especially apparent at the end of the song whenÂ  the primary guitar riff and vocals dissolve, leaving a number of previously background sounds exposed.Â  â€œWait, what was I just listening to?â€ And live, the possibilities are basically endless.Â  <strong>Elsner</strong> reflects, <em>â€œthe last time we played this song live it was an encore to some show we played in DC, and it turned into a crazy drum circle on stage with like half the audience and members of other bands all playing all the drums along with us, one of the coolest moments the band has been lucky enough to witness.â€</em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Shadow People [audio:AEM061 True Womanhood/02 Shadow People.mp3|titles=Shadow People|artists=True Womanhood]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - The Monk [audio:AEM061 True Womanhood/01 The Monk.mp3|titles=The Monk|artists=True Womanhood]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM061 True Womanhood.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Howard has a microKorg running through a wall of effects pedals, several test-tubes bubbling with green liquid, and a dead crab in a vat of grease. Vince is banging on a cymbal and improvising a tuneless shaman warble while waving his hands around like a octopus who has just been exposed to a deadly dose of scopolamine. The sound is ungodly, a near-platonic interpretation of the worst music in the world. Eventually, the pair grind the track to a close. Vince looks at Howard, smiling like a super-shy, zit-covered twelve-year-old who has just masturbated for the first time. <em>â€œHoward,â€</em> he says, barely able to contain his excitement, <em>â€œWeâ€™ve invented a new genre!â€</em>\r\n\r\nI bring this up because anyone whoâ€™s ever played music in a somewhat self-serious way has had this exact same epiphany at least fifteen times. The point isnâ€™t that Howard and Vince, or you or I, or that terrible ska band at the cross-campus barbecue are hopeless romantics ass-deep in their own personal mysticism. Itâ€™s that inventing a genre isnâ€™t the same as making a sound no one has heard before. I could fart into an echoplex and call it sniff-core and hope to God someone finds it interesting or hilarious. No, a new genre is about making a sound that everyone has heard before, just not in real life. Imagined musical futures, invented archetypes...thatâ€™s more like it. Thatâ€™s what <strong>Lingering Last Drops</strong>, a crazy fucking good band from Sao Paulo, are conjuring up in this particular bottle-tornado of cyclical history. \r\n\r\nWeâ€™ve seen some of the elementary particles of this music before: krautrock, freak folk, ambient dub, Throbbing Gristle, Bob Dylan, Flying Saucer Attack, Diamanda Galas. But, through some sort of Nobel-worthy experimentation, a new kind of microscope maybe, or an even larger Hadron Collider, <strong>Lingering Last Drops</strong> has produced prophetic and ingenious records of how those particles fit together, collide, mark quark babies. Imagine if Neu! were the bar band in Twin Peaks, or if the Basement Tapes were made in the cargo hold of Solaris with the oxygen levels hovering just above zero. The evil in these tracks isnâ€™t a sneer or a leather jacket but a death virus, a mummification ritual burned in .0000001 font on the back of a silicon chip. Reverbed-out guitars, synths that sound like resonating teeth, drums delayed out until infinity, voices that sound like Satanâ€™s out-of-the-office voicemail...you get the idea.\r\n\r\nBut not really until you listen to the songs. <strong>A-side â€œLove Shadow Syndromeâ€</strong> hovers weirdly on the edge of being pretty, like a girl-next-door type porn actress recovering from harelip surgery. Bendy demon surf guitars weave in and out of suffocating waves of synth pads, some syncopated tambourine motif hovering like scavenger gulls. The voice here is interesting too, somewhere between a Slint-ian breakdown whisper and a Nocturno Culto-esque frog burb. Eventually the whole thing disintegrates into hissing chaos, a CD skipping over the same patch of white noise forever, with, what else, a mellotron solo over it. I have to say, the audacity of that gesture is mad ballsy. \r\n\r\n\t<strong>â€œLight,â€</strong> the B-side, is both shorter and sparser, propulsive like a bad cough or a Serge Gainsberg track recorded from inside Melody Nelsonâ€™s skull. Thereâ€™s a groove somewhere in here, climbing up joint by joint out of a snow-covered grave, but itâ€™s so scattered, itchy-uncomfortable that it doesnâ€™t make you bob your head as much as squirm in your seat. When the circuitry babble outro comes in at 4:20 like a million bot fly babies suddenly exploding out of your forearm, itâ€™s hard not to seek out the nearest shower or bottle of Xanax. This might be the opposite of chill music, the kind of thing you might begin to hear if you broke out in a rash three minutes into a fifteen-year-long, cold-storage trip to the outer regions of space. \r\n\r\n\tThere still isnâ€™t really a name for the music <strong>Lingering Last Drops</strong> is making. There is, however, a sensation associated with it at once so specific you wonder how to get rid of it, and so universal you wonder why youâ€™ve never noticed it before. This band makes sounds so uncomfortable they should come with a prescription. I canâ€™t wait for the remix album. \r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Light [audio:AEM062 Lingering Last Drops/02 Light.mp3|titles=Light|artists=Lingering Last Drops]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Love Shadow Syndrome [audio:AEM062 Lingering Last Drops/01 Love Shadow Syndrome.mp3|titles=Love Shadow Syndrome|artists=Lingering Last Drops]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM062 Lingering Last Drops.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

First as half of the title of a song from Bill Callahan's fantastic(ally named) 2009 album <strong>Sometimes I Wish We Were An Eagle</strong>, and now as the title of an album by <strong>The Paparazzi</strong>, the solo project of <strong>Erik Paparazzi</strong>, who you may know as <strong>Cat Power's</strong> current bassist.  It refers to an ornamentation-heavy style of 18th century art, originating in France, which is usually referred to in dictionary definitions as <em>â€œfancifulâ€</em> or <em>â€œgayâ€</em> (no, really).  At first it seems like a strange word to apply to a rock album, but the more I listen to <strong>Rococo</strong>, the more it makes sense.  The songs are so lighthearted on the surface that it's easy to miss out on the endless series of carefully crafted hooks, guitar lines and arrangements that manage to sound as unlabored as if the band just made them up on the spot.  The addition of lots of little bits of studio chatter (the reverby speech in the middle of <strong>â€œThe Rococo Tapeâ€</strong> is instantly recognizable the band talking about the take they just played) is a clever device that helps keep this looseness present and dominant throughout even the most complex songs, though Paparazzi's yeah-I-can-sing-but-I'm-not-going-to-exert-myself delivery does a lot of the work as well.  \r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the looseness, <strong>The Paparazzi's</strong> songs are packed with a humor that comes out in all kinds of unexpected ways.  <strong>Paparazzi</strong> combines a love for puns and wordplay that hearkens back to John Lennon's early songs with a kind of free-associative nonsensical style that calls to mind Stephen Malkmus and gives us bizarre lyrics like â€œstaring down a praying mantisâ€ which are more about the sound of words than their meanings.  For an example of the former style, think of the two possible readings of the titular phrase from Lennon's â€œPlease Please Meâ€ and then check out the Paparazzi line from album-closer <strong>â€œFall (Into It)â€</strong> that hinges on the homophones of 'eye' and 'I': <em>â€œHey you with the lazy eye don't care.â€</em>  It's wordplay for the sake of wordplay, but it's appealingly easygoing.  It sounds like Paparazzi is having a lot of fun here, which means that it's easy to crack a smile at these little embellishments.  For another example, check out Ampeater <strong>B-side â€œEpic Proportions,â€</strong> which features lines like <em>â€œyou've got too much class for detention.â€</em> The puns go beyond lyrics as well, extending into the titles and arrangements, as on the song <strong>â€œUp, Up and Away (Major Scale),â€</strong> which features, you guessed it, a keyboard part that consists solely of the major scale.  But if this all sounds like too much, it's balanced by the fact that the songs that carry these lyrical games are rock solid, built with an old-school craftsmanship and instrumental skill that it's easy to overlook given how sweetly catchy and summery everything sounds.  There are a lot of brilliant little nods to great pop music of yore: hard-panned guitars, natural alternating meters (<strong>â€œThe Rococo Tapeâ€</strong> slips effortlessly back and forth between 4/4 and 6/4 in a way that reminds me in its unobtrusiveness of the â€œsun sun sun here it comesâ€ section of the Beatles' â€œHere Comes the Sun,â€ which actually dips into 5/4 though you'd never notice), four on the floor cowbell (more bands could stand to bring that back, it sounds great).\r\n\r\n\t<strong>A-side â€œThe Rococo Tapeâ€</strong> (home of the aforementioned cowbell) is a perfect representative of the lazy, summery sound of the record.  It struts forward for the first half, with <strong>Paparazzi's</strong> sassy extra syllables extending all the words, and then, after a precisely deployed harmonica comes out of nowhere and slips right back into that nowhere, disintegrates into some reverb-soaked studio chatter that gives way to a descending guitar riff that brings the song right back, only a little faster.  It's a total pop jam with a surprisingly weird and constantly shifting structure.  The talking in the middle almost serves as a kind of chorus, breaking up the similar first and second halves.  This bizarreness of form, which doesn't derail the song at all, actually turns out to be a blessing, as it lets the song maintain a feeling of surprise, which is almost impossible in recorded music.  No matter how many times you listen to â€œThe Rococo Tapeâ€, it always sounds like maybe something different is going to happen this time. \r\n\r\n\t<strong>â€œEpic Proportionsâ€</strong> is a self-referentially titled slow burner that starts with the sound of a match and some sparse piano chords before busting out another perfect guitar riff, one that manages to hit that unexpected flat six on the last chord and keep you from getting complacent.  It pairs perfectly with the ghostly female oohs that accompany it starting in the latter half of the song.  Despite its title, â€œEpic Proportionsâ€ is a song that refuses to get dramatic or lose its cool.  The song goes through a series of builds, but always pulls back into that acoustic guitar riff and loses the drums just at the moment you think it's going to let loose.  Take, for example, the moment, just before the 3 minute mark, where everything drops out under a crescendoing keyboard sound, and then, instead of the crash we're expecting, we get a return to the steady 4/4 time, and an incredibly sparse, chiming guitar. I've said before that delayed gratification is the key to great pop music, and this is no exception. Even <strong>Paparazzi's</strong> final leap into falsetto and the mob of overdubbed <em>â€œoh noâ€</em>s at the end of the song never really sound like they've lost control.  \r\n\r\n\t  All of <strong>The Paparazzi's</strong> music strikes a perfect balance between the kind of loose, flowing rock music people usually refer to as <em>â€œshambling,â€</em> and really excellent pop craftsmanship, resulting in some perfect jams to tide you over until the warm weather kicks in.  The two sides fit perfectly together to form songs that are simultaneously heavy and light, full on the one hand of lyrical puns and lighthearted touches like the little dissonant piano figure that pops up after the closing chords of <strong>â€œEpic Proportions,â€</strong> and on the other of varied and extended harmonies, guitar riffs that sound classic without sounding old, and rhythmic and metric shifts that keep you on your toes.  More bands would do well to remember that although sometimes songs with three chords are nice; most of the time things get a little more interesting with four.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Epic Proportions [audio:AEM063 The Paparazzi/02 Epic Proportions.mp3|titles=Epic Proportions|artists=Life Partners]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - The Rococo Tape [audio:AEM063 The Paparazzi/01 The Rococo Tape.mp3|titles=The Rococo Tape|artists=The Paparazzi]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM063 The Paparazzi.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Their full-throttle sound is a welcome holdover from their beginnings as a larger hardcore/postpunk outift called <strong>Surgery Sunday</strong>. The rock-n-roll laws of attrition whittled down this original group to <strong>Andrea Havis</strong> (guitar, vocals), <strong>Mike Gabry</strong> (bass, vocals), and former-drummer <strong>Justin Bilicki</strong>, prompting a namechange to the shorter Susu. The leaner, meaner unit hooked up with engineer Martin Bisi to record their self-titled debut in 2006. Bisi, whose credits include John Zorn, Sonic Youth, and Bootsy Collins, helped Susu find their signature hard-driving, paint-peeling sound. <em>â€œI think his influence was mostly present in the actual mixing and capturing of the song and sound,â€</em> as Havis recalls, <em>â€œHis drum sound is amazing. He really brings the instruments to life.â€</em> \r\n\r\nOne lineup shuffle later (<strong>Bilicki</strong> out, <strong>Oliver Riviera-Drew</strong> in) <strong>Susu</strong> found the loud and proud trio that has made a name for itself with three subsequent releases of pure sonic onslaught: <strong>Win</strong>, <strong>S/T</strong>, and their latest full-length <strong>R and R and R</strong>. The common denominator on all three releases has been a taste for defying conventional song structure. Experimentation, as <strong>Havis</strong> describes, <em>â€œâ€¦is about going over the line of what would be traditionally done in a \"song\", or doing it in a way that is outside the normal expectation. It's not necessarily reliant on how it will be received/perceived, but chosen because collectively we (Susu) all enjoy it, or it moves us to build upon it.â€</em>\r\n\r\nEschewing standard verse-chorus-verse formats, <strong>R and R and R</strong> is a provocative musical statement that will command you to attention with all the authority of a drill sergeant on acid. Most of the sonic vocabulary, the raw guitars and the howling vocals, are reminiscent of the textures of the No Wave scene of the 80s. Intense, raw, a little bit dangerous. Much of the avant-garde music that came out of New York during the 80s proved tremendously influential. But when you go back and listen to the recordings of early Sonic Youth, Theoretical Girl, and so forth, you canâ€™t help but feel the dingy audio doesnâ€™t do justice to the music. Even the <em>â€œhigh artâ€</em> symphonies of underground legend Glenn Branca sound pretty shoddy (Wharton Tiers didnâ€™t quite have his â€œAâ€ game going yet). <strong>Susu</strong> rescues some of the musical possibilities that are only hinted at in those old recordings and reconfigures the elements in Rauschenbergian, No Wave assemblages. The sonic collages are sometimes punky, sometimes proggy, and donâ€™t balk at trying something new. Drummer <strong>Riviera-Drew</strong> remarks, <em>\"We tend to flutter around a few ideas, then hover over one that seems to be of good quality.  Much like honey bees pollinating flowers.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThe A-side of the 7â€, <strong>â€œM.B.T.â€</strong>, comes off the <strong>R and R and R</strong> album, on which <strong>Susu</strong> teamed up with producers Keith Souza and Seth Manchester. â€œM.B.Tâ€ takes a few elements, acerbic guitar licks, Kim Gordon-howls, frenetic bass lines, and the spitfire drums of <strong>Oliver Riviera-Drew</strong>, and weaves the minimalist, iterative designs into a bracing artrock tableau. In a time when independent music seems overrun by synth textures and somewhat foggy composition, the unrelenting precision and musicianship of Susuâ€™s analog sound is genuinely shocking. Susu is tighter than a guidoâ€™s abs. The band flexes in a single unified motion, hurtling songs forward at breakneck speed and changing tempos at the drop of a dime. â€œM.B.T.â€ is not the sort of song that could be written alone in your bedroom on Garageband. The material on R and R and R was written in a collaborative procedure. As <strong>Havis</strong> describes it, <em>â€œâ€¦Everything is worked out real time. We get together and improvise, jam, what-have-you, until someone has this part sticking out that everyone is feeling. And then we tuck it away into our memories. And so on. Eventually we have these 5-25 parts that we name arbitrarily (but all understand), and someone will hear something that goes together. [For example] the â€˜chicken partâ€™ would sound great with the â€˜cheerleader partâ€™. And eventually we put them together and move the pieces around and we have a song.â€</em> The result is a level of organic unity and cohesion that holds their music together even as the compositional forms push the structural boundaries of what we expect to hear out of a pop song. The result is, in short, art.\r\n\r\nBut donâ€™t let the loud noises and artcore machismo fool you. <strong>Susu</strong> can be goofballs when they want to be. The track â€œLas Sirenasâ€ off their latest album will have you searching for your Spanish-English dictionary, and theyâ€™ve been know to bust out absurdist lyrics like <em>â€œIâ€™ve got a roof/With a view/For when I wake up/And donâ€™t know where I amâ€</em> on â€œClean vs. Dirty.â€ Naturally!\r\n\r\nFor their B-side, <strong>Susu</strong> brings it all the way back to 1983 with a cover of the Gloved Oneâ€™s epic single <strong>â€œBillie Jean.â€</strong> On the selection of the B-side, <strong>Havis</strong> remarks, <em>â€œIt's just a killer song. Mike just started whipping out the bass line constantly so we decided to cover it since it was so fun to hear. That whole album is truly incredible (obviously!). And then he died. And we happened to be going into the studio.. It's sort of a de-stresser song for us so we did it after we had tracked the record.. Just a quick take.â€</em> <strong>Riviera-Drew</strong> and <strong>Gabry</strong> hold down the rhythm section while Havis floats the dark, brooding melody over the top. The result is haunting yet danceable, as if all those zombies from the Thriller video picked up instruments and started jamming. The King of Pop would have approved.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s the combination of artcore firepower and absurdist flair that makes<strong> Susu</strong> special, and this 7â€ is a nice little introduction to their musical, Susu-ical vision. For the full experience of the brash trio out of Brooklyn, go check out an album or live show. The faint of heart (and short of humor) need not apply.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mike Gutierrez</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Billie Jean [audio:AEM064 Susu/02 Billie Jean.mp3|titles=Billie Jean|artists=Susu]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - M.B.T [audio:AEM064 Susu/01 MBT.mp3|titles=M.B.T.|artists=Susu]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear:both; padding-top:20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM064 Susu.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

She's worked with more rock superstars than most people have had jobs, yet she still remains appealingly enigmatic and (this is a dangerous word to throw around in talking about artists, but still) childlike. There's something about her music that manages to be completely open and simple and yet at the same time elusive and mysterious, much in the way of the wisdom of little children.  Her music is not, thankfully, cloyingly cute like most of the other artists who happen to strike, intentionally or not, the childlike aesthetic.\r\n\r\n\tTake, for example, her Ampeater <strong>B-side â€œThe Prince of Plati,â€</strong> drawn from her latest Young God release <strong>Magic Neighbor</strong>. The chord progressions are fairly simple, the vocals strong and at the fore in a style that calls to mind PJ Harvey and other un-wispy female singers, the lyrics direct and unambiguous in their plea to a lover for a little comfort and escape and play.  The song is appealing in part because it doesn't shy away from directness in search of some kind of untouchably cool ambiguity, something that is irritatingly common in younger songwriters. In fact, it's so direct and intimate, it almost feels voyeuristic to listen to it, something that's enhanced by lyrics like <em>â€œoh, nobody lookin/oh nobody see.â€</em>  The whole song stands, lyrically, as an attack on the narrator's own jadedness and an embrace of transient joys.  She wants to <em>â€œdo the things we did before we thought we knew,â€</em> to return to a time before her assumptions about what life is or isn't robbed her of the freedom to step outside her tired routines.  The mentions of storytelling and play, simplistic and well-worn metaphors (sadness = blue), really draw out the childlike core of the song, making it easy to understand why Gira has said that her music reminds him of <em>â€œearly Disney songs.â€</em>  \r\n\r\n\tThe unadorned and subtle arrangement enhances the simplicity and innocence of the song perfectly.  The chiming, upper register piano definitely brings the Disney thing back to mind, especially in the slightly off-kilter lydian melody that closes out the song.  As any modern jazz musician knows, the sharp 11 is the magic note that makes everything sound floaty and ethereal. Like all the other arrangements on <strong>Magic Neighbor</strong>, it was mostly worked out on the spot, and you can hear this in listening.  The bass and pedal steel parts are simple and they never step on the vocals, which remain right up front, inches from your ears, instead choosing to fill out the backdrop of the song with airy clouds of sound.  <strong>Germano's</strong> voice walks a fine line between the breathy vulnerability inherent to the lyrics and necessary to a song so intimate, and the strength that is obviously there to be tapped.  Rather than giving us everything she has, she draws us in by holding back.  \r\n\r\n\t<strong>A-side â€œReptileâ€</strong> works a similar magic, working a very familiar I IV V chord progression and bare bones rock beat into something that somehow sounds strange.  This simplicity is contrasted by the totally bizarre lyrics about light freaking out dying, God being a soul masturbator, and extraterrestrials handing out pamphlets of light to singers.  I have no idea, but it certainly puts some images in your head. â€œReptileâ€ was originally recorded for 7 Worlds Collide, an Oxfam-benefiting charity CD curated by<strong> Liam Finn</strong> (of <strong>Split Enz</strong> and <strong>Crowded House</strong> fame), and it features Finn and Wilco drummer/improvising musician Glenn Kotche collaborating (I think) on one the most awesomely asymmetrical drum parts I've ever heard in my life.  It kind of sounds like they brought them into the studio, and had them play along with the song the first time they'd ever heard it.  It's a kind of spontaneity that is so seldom heard in recorded music in a day and age when people tend to favor rigidly orchestrated parts over the conversational style of several musicians playing together, playing off one another (one could easily make the argument that this is a self-perpetuating cycle caused by a simultaneous rise of overdubbing and decline in technical skill among rock musicians, but that argument is probably best reserved for another forum).  The song itself is so easy to follow, and the main bass and snare pattern so constant, that the percussion track is able to slip into part after part on instrument after instrument (congas, woodblock, rhumba-infused rim clicks, big cymbal splashes, laconic hi-hat, atonal marimba, thundering toms, metallic shakers) and never risk losing the listener.  The fact that chorus of women's voices that kicks in on the chorus sounds like a group of untrained singers in a room (you can hear them laughing sporadically clapping during the song) only adds to the feeling of looseness and lightness that makes â€œReptileâ€ so lovely and lively. \r\n\r\n\t<strong>Germano's</strong> music these days is <em>â€œabout trying to be happy with all the sad shit in the world, dealing with your own fights and being the mighty one who rises above it,â€</em> and that is as straight-forward and noble a mission statement as I've heard from a musician in a long while.  It's plain as day when you listen to her songs that this is the truth, and, for those of us who'd rather explore than be inscrutably hip, it's as refreshing as a spray mister full of cold water on a summer afternoon in the park.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - The Prince of Plati [audio:AEM065 Lisa Germano/02 The Prince of Plati.mp3|titles=The Prince of Plati|artists=Lisa Germano]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Reptile [audio:AEM065 Lisa Germano/01 Reptile.mp3|titles=Reptile|artists=Lisa Germano]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear:both; padding-top:20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM065 Lisa Germano.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

By naming themselves  after the poor English family featured in the novel, are they asserting  their own poverty? Or, hailing from Oshawa, Ontario, do they consider  themselves second-bests to their more sophisticated <em>QuÃ©bÃ©cois</em>?  Or is the band â€“ which attained its complete form in college â€“using  such a literate reference ironically, a self-conscious acknowledgment  of their middle class privilege? The questions swirl in the background  as<strong> The Dâ€™Urbervilles</strong> donâ€™t so much lament their poverty â€“real  or imagined â€“ but rather use it a defiant rallying cry on <strong>â€œWe  Are the Hunters.â€</strong>\r\n\r\nThe first thing you think when  listening  to this A-side, though, isnâ€™t whether these guys are poor or  not: itâ€™s whether â€“ with the slap bass, manic energy and onslaught  of guitar hits â€“ itâ€™s going to be â€œWar Pigsâ€ done for the pacifist  set. But then it melds into a punk sing along that suggests they arenâ€™t  some limp-dicked indie band: <em>â€œWe are the Hunters, itâ€™s time for  killing!â€ </em>Exhausted? We havenâ€™t yet arrived at the infectious,  Depeche Mode-esque bridge, built on a bubbling base line that makes  it pretty much impossible not to do one of those bobbing 80s shakes. <em> â€œAt night we own the city skyline / By day we hide our selves from  sight</em><em>,â€</em> <strong>John Oâ€™Regan</strong> sings; <em>â€œMaking ends  meet/Burned up like a fire in the street / you can strike our hearts  anywhere you like.â€</em> Oâ€™Regan, who moonlights as Diamond RingsÂ  -  Side A on the PS I Love You split 7-inch that caught our attention last fall â€“ manages through his robust,  beautiful voice to convey both the weariness and defiance of the lyrics.   (His voice is even more incredible in person: I saw Oâ€™Regan perform  as <strong>Diamond Rings</strong> back in the fall in New York and was blown  away.)  The band only enters the 21<sup>st</sup> century at the triumphant  chorus,  sounding like the Killers without the bourgeois melodrama, synthesizer  and all. \r\n\r\nSo yeah, <strong>The  D'Urbervilles</strong> are kaleidoscopic. Their chutzpah itself is worthy  of praise: though plenty of bands experiment with different sounds,  itâ€™s actually somewhat incredible how <em>few</em> rock songs these  days change tempo or rhythm, let alone style. Iâ€™ve always been drawn  to this kind of virtuosity, built for the easily bored (or less  generously,  those with short attention spans). Of course there are endless great  songs that build to a climax with shifting-tempos, and plenty of showy  music-for-musicians (e.g. Zappa). But rarely do we see this  collage-minded  freely-borrowing approach, the best (and most famous) example of which  has to be the circus of freak-doo-wop â€œHappiness is a Warm Gun.â€\r\n\r\nBut <strong>The  Dâ€™Urbervilles</strong> are no Beatles, and upon first listen this rapid  juxtaposition, this drive-by of the last forty years of rock can be  appear jarring if not downright crude. They sound like a band that is  either completely aware of what theyâ€™re doing or totally clueless.  But upon repeat listens it becomes clear though the Dâ€™Urbervilles  try on many different musical outfits, they are so tight that they pull  it off. \r\n\r\nBut the other reason, the reason they  have incredible potential to be <em>successful</em> and great, is that  they root themselves in the trendy post-punk sound but use that as a  point of departure. Like the rest of their album of the same name, on <strong> â€œWe Are the Huntersâ€ The Dâ€™Urbervilles</strong> have all the elements  of that sound: pile-driving bass, generally minimalist arrangements,  and quickly shifting forms. While <strong>Tim Bruton</strong> does a fine job  on guitar and synth, it is the bass of <strong>Kyle Donnelly</strong> that  dominates  here, giving the band their appealingly Pixies-like meaty sound. But  instead of sticking to the formula, The Dâ€™Urbervilles add some hard  rock guitar here, sprinkle some synthesizer there until it comes out  just right. <em>Bon appÃ©t-indiÃ©. </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side  â€œWorst Case Ontarioâ€Â feat. New Slang</strong> sounds completely  different than anything else <strong>The Dâ€™Urbervilles</strong> have recorded.  It is, frankly, unrepresentative of their work â€“ but it sure shows  that these guys have a sense of humor. A self-mocking shout out to their   home state, the track starts out with a clip from perhaps the funniest  â€“ and trashiest â€“ piece of pop culture to emerge from our neighbors  up north: the Trailer Park Boys. Built around an old-school hip-hop  (read: funk) beat with similarly loose, simple vocals, the track  contains  such zingers as:Â  <em>â€œI ainâ€™t no moron/so I  swim in Lake Huron,â€</em> such sophisticated smack-downs of other states  like <em>â€œWhat the heck, Quebec?â€</em> and the classic taunt: <em>â€œDo  you have the balls to swim Niagara falls!?â€</em> They are more <em>â€œwiggidy-wiggidy-wiggidy-wacksâ€ </em> here than a Kriss-Kross single and they seem to be in that twelve year  old state of mind as well. Which is to say: they donâ€™t take themselves  too seriously. Thank god. \r\n\r\nThe <strong>Dâ€™Urbervilles </strong> are smart. They sing with sincerity, but always with a nod and a wink;  they address real issues with verve but arenâ€™t afraid to be completely  silly. They inhabit the hot sound of the moment but twist it in original   and exciting ways. And they prove that even in an age when rock is  becoming  more and more orchestrated, a hard bass and beautiful vocals are all  you really need to make a great song.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nick Kelly</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Worst Case Ontario [audio:AEM066 The DUrbervilles/02 Worst Case Ontario.mp3|titles=Worst Case Ontario|artists=The DUrbervilles/]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - We are the Hunters [audio:AEM066 The DUrbervilles/01 We are the Hunters.mp3|titles=We are the Hunters|artists=The DUrbervilles/]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM066 The DUrbervilles.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

For every shitheaded musical algorithm you could throw this artistâ€™s way, like if Cornelius had a sex change and re-recorded Tusk, or if, you know, Regina Spektor had ousted Aaliyah at the Timbaland audition, there is really only one accurate way of encompassing the emotional kick these tracks deliver. Maybe itâ€™s a thing about eponymous musicians, Prince, Madonna, whatever. But hereâ€™s the catch: I donâ€™t want to just listen to <strong>SAADI</strong> songs or go to SAADI shows; I want to be SAADI. After you hear the A and B sides, youâ€™ll probably feel similarly, and we can start a creepy support group for one another where we dress up and write borderline fan fiction.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s start with <strong>â€œPollen Seeking Bees,â€</strong> available in physical format this March on the <strong>Bad City 12â€</strong> released by our buddies at Serious Business. Whatâ€™s cool here is how potentially terrible that opening piano bang could have become. Think about it. No one really needs more fey, post-post-post K Records kiddy-ness on his or her iPod even if 10th grade was terrible and you never got to build that treehouse with your best friend before he moved to Utah. But here, from the four-second mark on, we know weâ€™re in the hands of a master technician, a performer who knows not only how to excoriate a cliche but how to twist one into all kinds of cool new balloon animals. That expertly syncopated scratch, those eternal Glaswegian <em>â€œaaahsâ€</em>...itâ€™s the kind of mix-up that allows you to accept that this song, like a particularly charming drunk or a Higgs boson, will probably do whatever the fuck it wants.\r\n\r\nA promo page on Serious Business says that <strong>SAADI</strong>, <em>â€œdraws from sources as diverse as Bob Dylan, classic 80's synth pop, traditional Arabic music, punk rock, Nigerian music and Brian Eno.â€</em> Thatâ€™s all well and good, and she probably does. But the point here is less the specificity of these taste-wise impulsesâ€”did you hear that Chief Ebenezer Obey sample?, and so onâ€”than the sense of sonic transience and mutability their even-illusory presence inspires. We are getting to the point in popular musicâ€”thanks Internet!â€”where genre has become an essentially empty category, and all that really matters is posturing and shout-outs. Record digging, for most of us, is a dead art, and Google is the new back of the CD store. Itâ€™s no big deal that one band can sound like Dinosaur Jr. meets Cybotron, or The Byrds meets John Cage. On the other hand, it is a big deal when influences stop being predictable, where the historical fabric of layered tracks and takes slides off the sewing machine. <strong>â€œPollen Seeking Beesâ€</strong> sounds like a bunch of things: rainy-day pop music, club rap, musique concrete. But the fusion is fluid, not forced. The songs set their own terms, and the classification scrambles to catch up.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œ3 am (Black Lodge)â€</strong> is similarly, um, different; an acoustic guitar figure, an electric wash that sounds like dividing cells look like under a microscope, <strong>SAADIâ€™s</strong> centered voice the constant that holds it all together. Itâ€™s not hard to imagine this as some late-career live recording by an artist youâ€™ve been told a million times to listen to but never have. Thereâ€™s an effortless confidence at play here, a sort of fan service for fan-base thatâ€™s still being created. It catches you up like an American at a European soccer match, shows you slides of an imagined community that you suddenly feel and will forever feel a part of.\r\n\r\n<strong>SAADI</strong>, in the vein of other transcendently forward-thinking female artists like Bridgitte Fontaine or Lizzie Mercier Descloux, doesnâ€™t have a hypothesis of what might sound amazing if interlaced at the right ratios. The experiment is concluded. Here are the results.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - 3 am (Black Lodge) [audio:AEM067 SAADI/02 3am Black Lodge.mp3|titles=3 am Black Lodge|artists=SAADI]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Pollen Seeking Bees [audio:AEM067 SAADI/01 Pollen Seeking Bees.mp3|titles=Pollen Seeking Bees|artists=SAADI]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM067 SAADI.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Kaplan finds it important to clarify that Day Sleeper is not a nod to the REM hit of the same name.  Actually it is a reference to <strong>Insomnia</strong>, Kaplan's former punk band, whose rejected material became Day Sleeper's early repertoire.  Eventually Day Sleeper grew into a band with the addition of guitarist <strong>Justin </strong><strong>Danforth</strong>, bassist <strong>Dan Ferm</strong>, and drummer <strong>Luke Pyenson</strong>.  They recorded their first album <strong>Drop Your Sword</strong> in 2008, while attending high school in Newton, MA and released it the following year through Cooling Pie Records, home to <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem047\">KC Quilty</a> among others.  Kaplan jokes that, <em>â€œthe album was well received, especially internationally, where oddly enough more Chinese websites have written about it than ones from any other country.â€</em> At any rate, I think it's due time that  Day Sleeper got a little love from the press back home and although I'm currently writing from a cafe in Seoulâ€”really it's just a minor technicalityâ€”I hope that this review will at long last introduce them to an American audience.\r\n\r\n<strong>Kaplan</strong> explains that <strong>A-side \"Windows Left Open\"</strong> was originally called \"Summertime\" and <em>â€œin one sense is meant to evoke the breeziness of that time of year.â€</em> Perhaps it does, although I cant help but wonder what that breeze carries.  Kaplan asserts that there's something <em>â€œcynical and sinisterâ€</em> about it and I agree that the song is altogether unsettling.  A distant rumble of thunder and the faint of rain are swept through that open window and pollute the summer afternoon with a foreboding dreariness.  Actually, â€œWindows Left Openâ€ is a fitting single for a band called <strong>Day Sleeper</strong>.  A lumbering 6/8 pulse and lack of harmonic resolution create a dreamy vibe.  It's a little like the feeling you get when you accidentally drift off in the mid afternoon and wake up drenched in a cool sweat, only to find that hours have passed and its already dark out.  It always takes a few minutes to figure out what happened, to remember where you are and even who you are.  Actually, it reminds me of a passage from <em>Swann's Way</em> in which Proust describes the sensation he felt as a child upon waking up.  This return to reality <em>â€œdid not shock my reason but lay heavy like scales on my eyes and kept them from realizing that the candlestick was no longer lit... I recovered my sight and I was amazed to find a darkness around me soft and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, to which it appeared a thing with out cause, incomprehensible, a thing truly dark.â€</em>\r\n\r\nI realize that I'm treading on thin ice with that reference.  <strong>Day Sleeper</strong> is not a pretentious hipster band and I don't think the comparison to Proust is one that they themselves would draw.  But whether or not they'd acknowledge it, their music evokes some of the same sensations.  It takes me to a special place where the boundaries between dream, memory, and reality are blurred.   A drugged-out lo-fi aesthetic reminiscent of Pavement is interspersed with brief moments of clarity.  In this case, the passage <em>â€œwhat have I left to sayâ€¦â€</em> in which the band breaks into a conventional three chord pattern feels like a chorus even though it only happens once and interrupts the disconcerting monotony of the groove.   <strong>Kaplan</strong> explains that <strong>\"Windows Left Open\"</strong> is indicative of Day Sleeper's current artistic direction.  <em>â€œThe guitars are tangled, the bass is leading, the drums are groovy and combative, and the vocals are melodic.â€</em> He also cites an emphasis on concision, which as a break from the bands <em>â€œshoegazingâ€</em> past.  \"Windows Left Open\" retains the washed out guitars and emotional restraint characteristic of shoegaze, but Kaplan's melodic vocal line is too distinct and the song's form far too compact to fit the archetypal shoegaze blueprint.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"Hiding Place\"</strong> is similarly dreamy.  I'd attribute that mostly to the vocals which sound suspiciously as if they were recorded under water.  Good luck making out a word the band is saying.  Here the human voice is used for its melodic qualities rather than as an instrument for speech. And yet the garbled words give the song a sort of haunting quality, as if there is some important message to be conveyed but it's lost in transmission. I should clarify that this recording is only a demo and that it was recorded in a dormitory.  Although it's hard to imagine now, in later incarnations the song will feature a prominent drum part.  <strong>Kaplan</strong> explains, <em>â€œI wish there was a version that had Luke's playing on it, because he really steals the show on this one live.â€</em> But even without drums, a strong pulse can be felt.  <strong>Ferm</strong>'s propulsive bass vamp strongly marks the downbeat and gives the song a sense of forward momentum.  <strong>Day Sleeper</strong> isn't exactly the kind of band to make me get up and dance but they insist that they really love it when people get into their music at shows.  In effort to get the crowd moving, <em>â€œI tried to give this one a little bounce and snap,â€</em> explains <strong>Kaplan</strong>.  Nevertheless, the predominant <em>â€œguitar philosophyâ€ </em>remains the same as in other Day Sleeper songs.  Principally, the guitars <em>â€œweave and dovetail around one anotherâ€</em> and move separately from section to section, paying little regard to the whole <em>â€œverse-chorus-verse thing.â€</em> And so, â€œHiding Placeâ€ strikes an interesting balance.  It's more groove oriented than most of Day Sleeper's material but it's so locked in that it becomes predictable.\r\n\r\nWhat's next for <strong>Day Sleeper</strong>?  They've got some major plans.  They hope to undertake the recording of a new album in the near future and to follow it up with a national tour.  In the mean time they're releasing a stopgap EP called <strong>Wonderland Kid</strong> featuring songs recorded at WERS at Emerson College in Boston, including <strong>A-side \"Windows Left Open\"</strong>.  Day Sleeper has always been an active live band, playing at venues ranging in size from the cramped 75-person basement of the Knitting Factory in NYC to Boston music stronghold TT The Bear's Place.  If you check out their MySpace page you'll notice that they pitch themselves as a BOS/NYC/CT/MTL band.  Most high school bands fall apart after their members are  scattered across the country by the college admission gods but Day Sleeper has managed to make the transition from a single-city high school band to a quad-city college band with remarkable grace.  They've been gigging across the full extent of their geographic range and intend to continue performing as frequently as their schedules will allow.  Coming soon to a venue near you...mark your calendars!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Hiding Place [audio:AEM068 Day Sleeper/02 Hiding Place.mp3|titles=Hiding Place|artists=Day Sleeper]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Windows Left Open [audio:AEM068 Day Sleeper/01 Windows Left Open.mp3|titles=Windows Left Open|artists=Day Sleeper]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM068 Day Sleeper.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

The bustling Toronto scene has been a neverending source of marvelous music  for us to present triumphantly to the open-eared public: <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem045\">Evening Hymns</a>,  <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem027\">PS I Love You</a>, <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem066\">The D'Urbervilles</a>, and now <strong>Kat Burns</strong>, aka <strong>KASHKA</strong>.Â    Burns' gorgeous voice and sharp songwriting skills (you try and slip  the word â€œdendrophiliacâ€ into a song without sounding like a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyhWwuDRoeY\" target=\"_blank\">jerk</a>) help make the wonderful <strong> Forest City Lovers</strong> what they are, but occasionally, prolific as  she is, she churns out some songs that don't quite fit into the FCL  template, and so she's taken on the KASHKA alter-ego to begin releasing  those songs, which swap the Lovers' sunny summer acoustics for a  subdued,  wintry electronic sound, probably more appropriate for Toronto.\r\n\r\n<strong>Burns</strong> describes <strong>KASHKA</strong> as <em>â€œthe outlet that many of my songs drift  into when they feel like they may float away otherwise,â€</em> and you  will instantly understand what she means.Â  Rather than the roots  and leaves of FCL, KASHKA songs sound like streetlights refracted  through  icicles. They are wintertime compositions (both were literally written  during the darkest evenings of winter), sonically filled out with  chiming  keyboards, tinkling bells, large spaces, and Burns' lovely, pure voice,  which, aside from carrying the melodies, functions as pretty much the  best synthesizer ever, whether she's creating warm choruses of chordal  oohs, fuzzy lead lines between verses, or serenely floating contrapuntal   melodies Ã  la a string section.Â  The thing that carries over from  the <strong>Lovers</strong> is Burns sense of precise and tasteful simplicity.Â   She knows in either case that her voice and knack for melody will carry  the song, and intelligently refrains from throwing any kind of  half-baked,  overly adorned arrangements into the mix.Â  Her vocals are mixed  to the front, so that they may lift the weight of the song, but they  are not pushed as far forward as is common to most electro-pop and they  don't share the ridiculously melismatic neo-soul that tends to make  you feel like someone spliced some vocals in from a recent American  Idol audition.Â  In fact, it's easy not to notice how wonderfully  skillful a singer she is until you start realizing how many of the  sounds  that fill out the airy space of these songs are not keyboards but rather   her voice.\r\n\r\nMaking  electro-pop (making <em>good</em> electro-pop, rather) has a couple of  inherent challenges, both of which <strong>KASHKA</strong> rises to effortlessly.Â    First, for your voice to slot nicely among all the pristine synth swells   and gentle blips, it has to be as on pitch and tightly controlled as  your SK-1. As you can hear in pretty much any moment of her Ampeater  single, this is not a problem for <strong>Burns</strong>, whose voice is as agile  as it is pretty, and somehow never cloying or tiring in the way of so  many singers gifted with exceptional vocal cords (this quality probably  owes a lot to her aforementioned intelligent restraint).Â  The second  major challenge is that when you're creating a music that essentially  exists only in digital space, and never as a full set of live sounds  in a room, it's really easy to succumb to the temptation to layer the  hell out of it (I know this because I pretty much always do so, no  matter  how pure my intentions are when I set out).Â  This is true of all  recording done mostly by overdubs, but I think it's a special difficulty   with electronic music, which has no acoustic corollary, and in which  it is easy to get excited about different synth sounds and just turn  everything into consonant-sounding mud, which is one of my least  favorite  sounds (it is a term that is also applicable to jam bands).Â  KASHKA  never has this problem.Â  Her music, with its softly muted beats  and warm clouds of voices, is perfectly refined and alluring.Â   There's not a hair out of place, and there are no screams for your  attention,  and this is precisely why it holds your ears so easily.\r\n\r\nDespite  the refinement and unflashiness I've been harping on, <strong>KASHKA</strong> doesn't come across as sparse or stark because those words imply a kind  of spiritual darkness that just isn't there.Â  Though the songs  are wintry, they are full of the warmth of huddling up by the fire after   a long walk in the snowy evening, full of hope in the face of  adversity.Â   The first lyric on <strong>A-side â€œHands Inâ€</strong> is, in fact, <em>â€œput  your hands in my heart tonight / just warm them there,â€</em> which  is all about love as a balm for cold weather, cold weather being of  course a shorthand for the larger cruelties of the world.Â  The  song begins with a quick but relaxed three note keyboard pattern that  manages to provide the entire harmony of the verse without ever playing  a single chord.Â  The harmony is so simple that we don't need any  more for our ears to understand exactly where we are, and what's  brilliant  about it is that we barely get any more:Â  another, far quieter,  single-note line, some muted percussion.Â  Eventually some single-note  guitar appears, along with some distant jangling bells, a light keyboard   melody, and some tom fills that always seem to signal the arrival of  hugeness, yet which always lead to nothing, not even a crash on the  downbeat.Â  All these elements slowly and gradually coalesce to  create the filled out song, and just at the moment when you hear this,  it slips away, leaving only the echo of the bells (which are brilliantly   buried in the mix so that you may not have even noticed them until this  precise moment).Â  The only response is to listen to it again.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œLonely  Creaturesâ€</strong> begins with an absence as well, withholding all the  low end through the first verse to achieve that untethered, airy sound  before eventually culminating in the busiest, thickest sound on the  whole single, which is of course still rather delicate. My absolute  favorite moment in the song only comes once (of course), and it's right  at 2:15, in the middle of the chorus, where <strong>Burns</strong> comes in with  an ethereal ooh which is broken up into sixteenth notes in a way that  echoes the rolling beats of the chorus and calls to mind images of  rippling  water.Â  But it's hard to even pick a favorite moment in <strong>â€œLonely  Creatures.â€</strong> All of the background vocal work is unbelievably  beautiful, and so is the third repetition of the chorus line, when it  slides up with the ease of warm breath rising into cold air.Â  The  call for all the lonely city-dwellers to come together and create a  spark of heat together is a perfect call-to-arms for someone concerned  primarily with spreading love and warmth, and though it makes for a  stark contrast with the <em>â€œicy breasts of morningâ€</em> and catalogues  of inhibitions in the lyrics, what stays with you after listening is  not the icy expanse of the backing track but the humanity and warmth  of Burns' voice, reminding us that, when faced with the harsh winters  of the world, our greatest asset is the heat radiating from our bodies  and the love radiating from our hearts.\r\n\r\nP.S. If you were wondering  how <strong>â€œLonely Creaturesâ€</strong>Â would sound if you accidentally played  Gyorgy Ligeti's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI0P1NnUFxc\" target=\"_blank\">\"Atmospheresâ€</a> over it, the answer is REALLY, REALLY AWESOME.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Lonely Creatures [audio:AEM069 KASHKA/02 Lonely Creatures.mp3|titles=Lonely Creatures|artists=KASHKA]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png'); \" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Hands In [audio:AEM069 KASHKA/01 Hands In.mp3|titles=Hands In|artists=KASHKA]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM069 KASHKA.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

His first two records,  2007's <strong>What the Night Said</strong> and 2009's <strong>No Wonder</strong>, were  received warmly by fans of beautiful acoustic pop songs with  spiderweb-delicate fingerpicking and hushed, intimate vocals.  For them  he garnered innumerable Nick Drake comparisons and honest, thoughtful  praise from many corners of the media.  Coke Machine Glow called No  Wonder <em>â€œa lovely, humble, mature record  from a person who seems like a lovely, humble, mature human being,â€</em> and this is exactly how it feels to listen to  it.  Mature and humble are hardly the attributes that get the blog  hormones flowing these days, but in some ways we are reaping the  benefits of the fact that Stratton hasn't completely blown up in the  hyperbolic, slavering world of blog music journalism.  No Wonder was a  perfectly lovely album that could have been replicated for an entire  career (see Damien Jurado, for example).  It is dramatic enough to be  moving without coming anywhere close to gaudiness, simple and  understated enough to seem completely uncontrived, intelligent enough to  ring true in a way that surpasses platitudes, and warm enough that you  get an immediate sense of the human heart behind the songs.  The drama  in it comes from delicate internal moments like walking home, alone and  lovestruck, after a party, the way it often does in real life, at least  for the kind of people who tend to listen to melancholic acoustic pop  music that is heavy on the I-IV chord progressions and literate lyrics  (I can be mildly snarky because I count myself squarely in this camp).   Stratton could have had a lovely career working within those  straight-forward song forms, but he has the searching and self-critical  personality of an artist, rather than just a craftsman.\r\n\r\n<strong>Stratton</strong> was  very young when he recorded those two albums (he still is, really), and  had he been launched into the slobbery jaws of even indie-stardom, we  might not be seeing the kind of growth we can see in his new music, some  of which he has kindly allowed Ampeater to convey to you, the people.   The appeal of the delicate, melancholy, direct songs of his first two  albums is strong, and it hasn't been banished by any means, but here  Stratton begins to mold it into something less predictable and more  expansive.  I'll let him speak for himself because he is incredibly  eloquent: <em>â€œThere is a single spiritual  position that exists in songs like [Nick Drake's] â€œWhich Will\" that is  so strong that, when you hear it, it seems like it becomes the only  thing that exists in the world(...)That kind of music, written from a  place of such isolation, has the illusion of clarity. Maybe it has real  clarity, it's hard for me to say. Either way, I'm tired of being in that  place. I want to forge out on my own and wind up some place I don't  recognize. I want to learn to express very specific moments of anger,  flirtatiousness, joy--all things that are more or less absent in Nick  Drake's music--with the same sort of gutwrenching precision that he used  to express the false sense of omniscience that accompanies deep  despair.â€ </em>\r\n\r\nAfter  all that setup, you're probably expecting some death metal or fifteen  minute guitar solos or synthy 80's pop.  Well, there's none of that, but  improvisation does play a key role these songs in a way that it never  has before.<strong> A-side â€œBluebellsâ€</strong> commences with an open piano-figure that  recalls the beginning of Bon Iver's â€œBabysâ€, but which is harmonically  static and probably comes instead from interest in recent minimalist classical music (our conversation was educational  for me in this arena, to say the least, but I recommend checking out  John Luther Adams, David Lang, Arvo Part, &amp; Gavin Bryars for  starters).  Over this piano drone, <strong>Stratton</strong> lays out a few minutes of  warm, tumbling guitar, all of which was improvised.  He has lately taken  to using first takes, saying that <em>â€œit keeps me thinking on my toes.â€</em> This interest in spontaneity is another bold  move, directly in opposition to the precise and measured craft of his  previous work, yet one which serves the song to the very same extent  that Stratton's simpler pop forms served his earlier work.  Here it  serves as both a counterweight to the minimal and gorgeous piano/vocals  outro and as a kind of mood-setter, capturing an expansive, still  feeling that isn't easily conveyable through traditional songwriting.   It's something we haven't heard from Stratton before, a sound that seems  to call to mind wide open landscapes at dawn, the sun slowly infusing  the crevices of rocks with its light.\r\n\r\nIt's onto this landscape that <strong>Stratton</strong> projects his melancholy song, yet there's something strangely dusty and  distant about the sadness in <strong>â€œBluebellsâ€</strong>.  The effects obscure his voice just enough to  render it ghostly, almost like a voice from the past (you can just  barely hear it hovering behind the guitar solos), and the song is  narrated in the second person, making it about the listener rather than  the singer.  It's a subtly alarming shift, putting us in the position of  being hopelessly lost, rather than safely empathizing with a narrator  who is hopelessly lost.  The clashing guitars that rise up around the  four minute mark, crackling and slashing one another like contentious  bolts of lightning, infuse the song with a dissonance that, though it  disappears quickly, enhances this air of desperation and sadness,  especially when we're lead out into a beautiful piano and vocal section  only to hear the line <em>â€œby now you must have  been certain that it had all been a lieâ€</em>.  When the narrator tells us that we still kept  searching for our lost love, it's hard to tell whether it's sweet or  pathetic, and this ambiguity is crushingly sad.  Are we deluded or  determined?  Both?  Also to be noted, over the middle section with it's  minimal backbeat, when Stratton is singing <em>â€œwhich way did my darling go?â€</em>, is the way the bass note on the guitar  gradually bends up from the four chord to the five, introducing some  dissonant intermediate notes and a sense of unease and muted violence  that wouldn't be present if he'd just played the chord progression  straight.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œThe Hudson Lineâ€</strong> is as close to <strong>Stratton's</strong> earlier work as anything he sent us.  His voice is stripped of the  effects that mask it on <strong>â€œBluebellsâ€</strong> and left to cut clearly over the beautiful  lattice of fingerpicked acoustic guitar.  It is a love song, yet it's  not so much a declaration of love as an assessment of a love that has  come and gone.  The moments of sweetness are now tempered by the  temporal distance, and the wistful mood is perfectly captured by the  lines<em> â€œall I know all I know all I  know / is all greatness is born out of sin / but somehow I saw youâ€.</em> The narrator's relationship with the woman is  something born out of sin, yet at the same time it seems to be the one  thing that transcends this tautology.  It's a sweetness that is rendered  all the sweeter by the darkness of the worldview in which it sits.  The  background against which these lyrics are set is appropriately lovely  and delicate, yet it's easy to miss just how amazing and skillful the  rhythmic interplay is between the thumb and the rest of the hand.   Stratton, though he's no show off, is an incredibly agile and creative  guitarist, with a sense of play that allows him to slip away from the  expected patterns of folk and rock guitar.  Aside from providing a  harmonic backbone, the guitar here frequently subdivides the bar into  uneven groups of threes, giving the song a rolling feeling mirrored in  the lyrics about <em>â€œgalloping along the  Hudson Line.â€</em>\r\n\r\nThese exclusive tracks represent the evocative  songwriting <strong>Stratton</strong> is known for, only evolved to the next step.   Thankfully for us listeners, he is a person who is constantly pushing  himself forward, stretching for something just beyond his reach.  We  have the luxury of being able to sit back and immerse ourselves in the  discoveries he makes along the way, the beautiful music that composes  Will Stratton's journey through the world.  Stay tuned for another  digital 7â€ in the coming weeks, as well as greater portions of the  interview.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: left; padding-left: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Bluebells [audio:AEM070 Will Stratton/01 Bluebells.mp3|titles=Bluebells|artists=Will Stratton]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: left; padding-left: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - The Hudson Line [audio:AEM070 Will Stratton/02 The Hudson Line.mp3|titles=The Hudson Line|artists=Will Stratton]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM070 Will Stratton.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright  pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Peasant\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Peasant-300x142.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"142\" />There's a certain kind of delicate music that quickly divides listeners into distinct camps; we're either enthralled by its ethereal melodies or utterly bored by the appalling infrequency of extended drum solos and full stacks of Marshall amplifiers. I happen to love acoustic music for its simplicity, candor, and occasional brilliance. But, I can see where the other guys are coming from and usually refrain from forcing the latest Neil Halstead solo project or Sufjan Stevens solo banjo tape on my friends and colleagues that favor music with a bit more oomph. Only occasionally does an artist come along that so perfectly transcends the framework of expectations for acoustic music that I feel moved (compelled, actually) to share his full catalog with everyone I meet on the street, regardless of their musical inclinations. This happened with DIY savant <strong>Damien DeRose</strong>, known as <strong>Peasant</strong>.\r\n\r\nI get the sense, listening to <strong>Peasant's</strong> songs, that he's experienced life more completely than I have, and that my best hope at redemption is to absorb his music so thoroughly that I vicariously benefit from the flood of emotional wisdom that pours out from every word he sings. Then again, to say that <strong>Damien DeRose</strong> took <em>\"the road less traveled\"</em> in this life would be a gross understatement. He began his education at an experimental school that embraced a profoundly unorthodox style of education. He and his classmates spent their days going for walks, taking care of farm animals, and fashioning their own pens from feather quills. Fortunately for us, this unconventional curriculum included enormous amounts of group singing, with a repertoire that consisted primarily of traditional folk songs (I knew I heard traces of that <em>\"high lonesome sound\"</em>). During his adolescent years DeRose compiled an arsenal of instruments, beginning with piano and violin, then moving to drums, guitar, bass, banjo, and harmonica. He spent his high school years, like many budding musicians of our fine generation, playing Weezer covers in shitty rock bands. Then, in what must have seemed like a crushing blow at the time, he was kicked out of school and cut loose to forge his own path. This unexpected and unsought freedom very likely served as the greatest possible boon to his development as a songwriter. The period that followed was a rough one, wrought with what in retrospect might be construed as adventure. He moved to California and bought a sailboat with a friend, but the boat sunk (was sunk, actually, by sea lions) before it ever saw open ocean. So he traveled around the US and Europe, collecting whatever inspiration the world had to offer. De Rose came out on the other side of this adventure seasoned, but also very much affected by the daily grind of forging one's own existence at an age when the majority of his peers were most concerned with what to wear at the next college social--so much so that he gave himself the humble stage name Peasant. Having been on the receiving end of too many $7/hr day jobs, broken relationships, and chance encounters, Peasant bears the weight of the world on his shoulders, and his songs are perfect capsules of emotion, contained and conveyed by a musical impulse that's nothing short of brilliant.\r\n\r\nWhen we spoke on the phone, <strong>Peasant</strong> said he writes <em>\"songs about feelings that produce those feelings.\"</em> Songs to inspire love, to incite hatred, to send a confident man to the depths of self-loathing and then draw him back again. This is one of the greatest accomplishments of high art, and while many an artist might make this claim, Peasant undoubtedly succeeds. The songs on this 7-inch are both home-recording ventures, forged over many months in an attic in <strong>DeRose's</strong> home town of Doyleston, PA. They're recorded with the kind of compulsive attention that's impossible in a formal recording studio. Every sound is meticulously captured, adjusted, re-recorded, mixed, re-mixed, and scrutinized. The soundscape's layered without being lush; the end result is both decidedly unique and perfectly suitable to the dreamy melancholy of Peasant's music. I'm tempted to make comparisons to Elliot Smith and Brian Wilson, but Peasant's music isn't so easily reduced to the sum of its influences.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side \"The Distance\"</strong> evokes the same world of aimlessness and isolation as Simon &amp; Garfunkel's \"America\". It's the perfect snapshot of your long lost older brother, sitting alone on the back seat of a bus like a still frame from some unmade Wes Anderson remake of Into The Wild. It's about losing people--not to death or depravity, but to the simple distractions and the natural dispersion of a normal life. He sings,\r\n\r\n<em>\"I've been walking in the city and wandering far away.\r\nI've been falling through the fields and hiding every day.\r\nI've been holding onto everything, all that I have.\r\nI'm hoping I can come out the other side.\r\nBeen sleeping in the moonlight, and running through the days.\r\nBeen waiting for the troubles to go away. </em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em><em>Where have you been my lover?\r\nWhere have you gone, my friends?\r\nFading through the distance of each other.\r\nWhat have we done, my brother?\r\nHave we all gone away?\r\nI'm listening to the distance of the past.\" </em>\r\n\r\nA simple two chord progression sends the song on a steady trajectory from the onset, each change propelling listeners one step further on some gradually unfolding journey. Like <strong>DeRose</strong> said, it's a song about distance that induces the perception of distance in anyone within earshot. What a trick. The arrangement is complex but so delicately balanced that it's possible to listen through the song without fully hearing the dozens of overdubbed parts that DeRose weaves through the basic framework of guitar and vocals. There are multiple keyboards, layered vocal harmonies, and even some figures that sound a bit like backwards tape loops (around 1:45). It all blends into a sonic stew, with DeRose's voice in the forefront as the most prominent ingredient. It's delicate but not fragile, sensitive but not overly expressive. It's earnest. This isn't a song written by someone so overly-conscious of songwriting as to do anything to deliberately subvert the tradition. That said, he isn't merely following in tow either; it's a refreshing mixture of truly original composition and deeply personal expression.\r\n\r\nA hollow piano and relaxed snare usher in <strong>B-side \"Well Alright,\"</strong> another tune based on a repeated two chord progression. It doesn't do much to start, but just as I'd normally began to reach towards that skip button, <strong>DeRose</strong> enters with the line, <em>\"You tell me that I look like I'm gone when I'm around\"</em> and the song launches into an anthem for dissatisfied couples (if dissatisfied couples even have anthemsâ€¦I guess it's like having \"our song\" but instead of nuzzling you just sit in cold silence). Like on <strong>\"The Distance,\"</strong> <strong>\"Well Alright\"</strong>'s main hook is achieved by introducing new harmonic movement to the mix in conjunction with a higher vocal melody. To the extent that it's a formula, it's a formula for success. At one point DeRose sings, <em>\"I'm trying to find the answers in myself, I'm trying to find the reasons in my head, I don't wanna drift away the days.\"</em> There's a resonance here with \"The Distance\" in so much as Peasant is very clearly on a search. Though he's settled down since his post-high school excursions, he's embarked upon a new exploration--more mature perhaps, but more difficult to complete. It's the inevitable dichotomy between living a stationary life while making creative and intellectual progress, all the while sustaining those vital personal connections forged in the preceding decades. It ain't easy, but if the broader search for that perfect balance does indeed continue for Damien DeRose, he can rest assured that he's created something special in the music presented on this 7-inch.

Most of the bands that we work with chose an accessible A-side to hook new listeners and a more experimental B-side for the adventurous listener.  But Austin-based band <strong>The Laughing</strong> has taken their selection a bit more seriously and, upping the ante, they've presented us with something unprecedentedâ€”a concept 7-inch.  Get ready for â€œpop music as envisioned by The Laughing.\"\r\n\r\nYou're probably scratching your forehead right now and wondering just who the hell <strong>The Laughing</strong> is and what their vision of pop music could possibly entail.  I'll admit I was a bit skeptical too at first.  But this isn't the vague and far flung pile of bullshit you tried to pass off as your comp lit thesis, it's a bold vision that The Laughing paints with remarkable clarity and confidence.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Laughing</strong> is a four-piece rock band but don't be fooled by the conventional lineup.  Featuring <strong>Logan Middleton</strong> on guitars and vocals, <strong>Sean Neesely</strong> on bass, <strong>Grant van Amburgh</strong> on drums, and <strong>Adam Glasseye</strong> on organ, the band likes to keep it fresh by tossing bells, dulcimers, ukuleles, synthesizers, clarinets, flutes, an array of percussion, and any other noises they can dream up into the mix.  They draw inspiration from music, both popular and experimental, that spans eras.  The band explains that their varied instrumentation and ornamental arrangements <em>â€œadorn core song structures and melodies that take cues from the likes of Harry Nilsson, Os Mutantes, Jorge Bem, Silver Apples, Love, Roxy Music, Sonic Youth, 13th Floor Elevators  and more.â€</em> Yet the recipe is so complicated that the ingredients become obscured.  What do they do?  The Laughing manage to drum up the same excitement that pop music once inspired but now lacks.  How do they do it?  By milking a century's worth of music for everything its worth and fucking it up beyond recognition.  The product captures the spirit of pop without seeming derivative.  There are very few bands out there that can do what The Laughing is doing right now.\r\n\r\nLet's listen to <strong>A-side \"Runner.\"</strong> <strong>Middleton</strong> explains, <em>â€œwe present a core melodic and chordal structure of a classic early 60's R &amp; B influenced American pop song, that got unknowingly dosed  with some sort potent combination of psychotropic substance and amphetamines.â€</em> Awesome.  <em>â€œIf someone had informed Sam Cooke ahead of time how his brilliant career was going to come to such a violent and bizarre end,â€</em> Middleton continues, <em>â€œhe might have have leaned his later compositions in this direction.  Incorporating a little 80's new wave synth on top of Hammond organ the song is considerably faster,  and more unhinged  than the traditional pop form on which its based.  Lyrically swapping out the innocence of the 50's  with a tinge of cynicism, all the while  singing the same old song: I love you... I messed up.... now I want you back!\"</em>\r\n\r\n<em>â€œI messed up,â€</em> might be the dominant theme, but <strong>Middleton</strong> delivers it with such a cocky drunken American punch that one couldn't exactly call it apologetic.  In his deep vibrato and swooping melodies I hear traces of Presley to Pavarotti, Dr. Martin Luther King to Oscar de Leon to a laughing hyena.  <strong>The Laughing's</strong> style is bold and resonant but a little wild, accompanied well by a whiskey on the rocks.  And what about Sam Cooke?  My hunch is that even if he'd had the foresight to imagine what happened at the Hacienda Motel on that fateful night, he wouldn't have created something quite so perverse as <strong>\"Runner.\"</strong> Yes, perverse.  Why?  Because it's out of control.  It's an uncensored portrait of the inner workings of the diseased mind.  And you can't look away no matter how hard you try.\r\n\r\nSometimes when I'm listening to music I'll zone out and without any conscious effort I'll orchestrate an elaborate scene for which the music is the soundtrack.  These scenes play out in my mind shot by shot, as if I were reading the storyboard of a film. <strong>\"Runner\"</strong> is the soundtrack to a chase scene.  Frantic synths and guitars push the narrative along at breakneck pace.  As the momentum builds, the cuts get more rapid.  The screaming guitar becomes the screaming of breaks.  Alternating drum and noise breaks on the bridge mark cut to after cut to!  The drums break into a steady roll and the song explodes.  Don't expect to listen passively.  This spirit is contagious.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"Help Me\"</strong> is a little less frantic.  <strong>Middleton</strong> explains that <em>â€œit slows things up and strips things down.â€</em> But please don't get the wrong idea.  \"Help Me\" is no ballad.  It's a dancing-on-the-kitchen-table-in-your-underwear-and shouting-into-a-broomstick kind of song.  To put it more directly, \"Help Me\" is not a song for normal people.  Though outwardly upbeat it's deranged at the core and has a deceptively calm energy that builds steadily throughout.  <em>â€œBringing in the ukulele and substituting the the persistent drums with hand claps and shakers,â€</em> says Middleton, <em>â€œwe depict a more personal account of some one in a sticky situation that stubbornly wants to be left alone to sort things out for himself.   The title along with the overly re-assuring lyrical content betray this idea though, instead revealing that this person, really does need help!  Complete with synth arpegiators and a ghetto-blastered-out finale we wanted to give the listener something to shout along to, while their 'subs'  rattle their neighbors coffee-table collectibles.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Help Me\"</strong> lacks the force of <strong>\"Runner\"</strong> but more than compensates for that with catchy hooks and  unconventional instrumentation.  The chorus is beautiful for its simplicity.  At only three words and four chords it's easy (and nearly impossible)to forget.  <em>â€œDon't help me...â€</em> As <strong>Middleton</strong> emphasizes, in context the lyrics appear ironic, the music suspiciously peppy.   The plea is altogether unconvincing, it lacks composure.\r\n\r\nBoth <strong>\"Runner\"</strong> and <strong>\"Help Me\"</strong> come from <strong>The Laughing's</strong> debut album, <strong>FEVER</strong>, which they released in 2009.   Borrowing from the production tactics of genres as diverse as classic dub and noise rock, the album was collaboratively engineered by Erik Wofford (Black Angels, Voxtrot), Danny Reisch (The Lemurs), and <strong>Middleton</strong> himself.  FEVER juxtaposes the <em>â€œwarmth of analogue tape and vintage effectsâ€ with the â€œinfinite other-worldliness of digital.â€</em> Every track is memorable, interesting, and theatricâ€¦ even the ones deceptively titled â€œ(((pause)))â€ and â€œ(((silence)))â€  Middleton explains that FEVER is named after a book he discovered as a child that discusses his grandfather Dr. John Frame's discovery and treatment of Lassa Fever in Africa many years ago.  <em>â€œI liked it as it thematically ties in with the topic of the diseased (mostly mentally diseased) people throughout the album, but can also equally refer to a sense of fanaticism for something,â€</em> he adds.\r\n\r\nMaybe itâ€™s a disease and maybe itâ€™s a fanaticism, where do we draw the line?  Whatever the â€˜feverâ€™ is, <strong>The Laughing</strong> has it.  Just listen to their wild and meticulously arranged music and I think you'll understand what I mean.  This band is a little bit crazy and a large bit brilliant.   Catch them next month SXSW.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Help Me [audio:AEM072 The Laughing/02 Help Me.mp3|titles=Help Me|artists=The Laughing]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Runner [audio:AEM072 The Laughing/01 Runner.mp3|titles=Runner|artists=The Laughing]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM072 The Laughing.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\"><img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px;\" title=\"Liturgy\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Liturgy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" />If you are a serious, disciplined listener of music, black metal might be an as-of-yet unwritten entry in your encyclopedic grasp of music and its oft notorious sub genres. You might view it as elusive or even contradictory. Perhaps you find it overly serious, dark, depressing, maybe even <a href=\"http://www.metalexpressradio.com/images/news/images/immortal.jpg\">unintentionally funny and ridiculous</a>. But there it is, this entry, unfinished and perhaps unfairly ignored. Black metal traces its origin to thrash metal acts like Venom and Bathory but its real history begins in the early 90s in Norway where bands like Mayhem, Immortal, Emperor, and Darkthrone perfected a raw, low fidelity sound defined by trebly guitars, continuous pounding double kick drums, tortured vocals, and pagan, anti-Christian lyrical content. It was a scene that was linked to murders (most notably the murder of Mayhem's Ã˜ystein \"Euronymous\" Aarseth at the hands of Varg Vikernes, who still records under the moniker Burzum), the arson of dozens of historic Stave churches throughout Norway (some at the hands of <a href=\"http://www.mic.no/nmi.nsf/pic/burzum_01/$file/burzum_01.jpg\">Varg Vikernes himself</a>), and suicide (most notably by Mayhem's vocalist Per \"Dead\" Ohlin). Black metal's \"second wave\" was met with a satanic panic of press in Norway and all over the globe. Its corpse-painted performers were seen less as members of a musical sub genre and more as willful participants in out and out Satanism and far-right politics, a reactionary categorization that still permeates accounts of black metal's history and current iterations, most notably in Michael Moyinhan's Lords of Chaos, a book which has been criticized for failing to dispel this categorization and even tacitly endorsing this (mis)understanding of the music. Varg Virkenes denied accusations of Satanism and insisted this (or maybe his) music was something more primitivist, a-Christian, and neo-pagan. Yet he aligned himself with toxically xenophobic political viewpoints, and although he (and the incredibly nascent national socialist black metal movement) operate within an extreme minority of an already obscure genre, the associations stick. Darkthrone's Fenriz dismissed any political associations whatsoever, and his <a href=\"http://images.hugi.is/metall/148307.png\">jovial, light-hearted demeanor</a> belies Varg's self-seriousness and the genre's stereotypically dismal attitude. Whatever \"second wave\" black metal was, it was the ultimate enactment of what extreme music always masqueraded as and never quite was, it was excess and violence and confusion. Yet, theological and semantic arguments regarding \"Satanism\" aside, it was absolutely misanthropic, anti-Christian, and deeply nihilistic.\r\n\r\nAmerican black metal, if anything, further internalized these themes. Though the Norse originators were bands who weren't shy of the things bands doâ€”who were perhaps straightforwardly debaucherous individuals behind all their cryptic pseudonyms, painted faces, and a darker-than-thou ethosâ€”their American counterparts had become one man \"hordes,\" known only by their pseudonyms. Leviathan's <a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/89/242954580_5eff2a7aa2.jpg?v=0\">Wrest</a> and Xasthur's <a href=\"http://www.icedtears.com/musica/fotos/1036.jpg\">Malefic</a> are particularly salient examples (not to mention associated acts Weakling or Lurker of Chalice), seeming ascetics who shun live performance, interview requests, and anything beyond a sustainable baseline of existence, musicians who deeply embody black metal's extreme emotional negativity. And even among the more public, performance-based bandsâ€”from Washington's eco-pagan Wolves in the Throne Room to Texas's esoteric, somewhat traditionalist Absuâ€”the commitment to nihilism and \"darkness\" remains. And then there is New York's <strong>Liturgy</strong>. Perhaps such a historical introduction is unnecessary, but if it seems over-indulgent let me clarify. This musical lineage, at least its European strain, is something Liturgy, a solo project cum four-piece from Brooklyn, pays particular attention to. I think, most of all, it is something they pay particular attention to because they seek to destroy it, to create something new with the pieces, to attempt a musical evolution. Or, at least, another evolutionary strain.\r\n\r\nOn December 19th of last year, <strong>Liturgy's</strong> founder and principle member <strong>Hunter Hunt-Hendrix</strong> spoke at a symposium of black metal theory in Brooklyn entitled \"Hideous Gnosis\", his lecture on \"Transcendental Black Metal\" appears in a recently published book containing the essays presented at the symposium. In a dark bar in Brooklyn Hunter urged for a black metal of \"affirmation\" over \"nihilism,\" \"hypertrophy\" over \"atrophy,\" and \"courage\" over \"depravity\". In a sense, he asked black metal to be black metal and also its opposite.  As he tells me, this new iteration of black metal â€œ<em>should channel and renew the spirit of liberation, and it should consume everything that's out there and reterritorialize it on the basis of a vision of apocalyptic ecstasy</em>\". There is an inherent openness to this approach, and perhaps not a more fitting name than Liturgyâ€”this is black metal to be played publically in sunlight, in joyous almost spiritual ecstasy. It is this in the face of black metal's inherent dark void, perhaps even embracing it, standing above and looking inside.\r\n\r\nIt might all sound entirely convoluted but I swear this imagery makes sense as soon as you hear the music. At any moment <strong>Liturgy's</strong> pieces sound like they are going to self destruct, to be sucked back down as severed arms and guitar strings and drum sticks into the eternal void its predecessors lauded. But before we get there we have <strong>Side A, a subdued untitled track</strong> (one of many interesting near-ambient pieces peppered throughout the album) that starts off Liturgy's debut as a full fledged band, <strong>Renihilation</strong>, and serves as a prelude to its second track, <strong>Side B's \"Pagan Dawn\"</strong>. Over its brief two minute span a vocal incantation slowly builds on itself and anticipates a coming storm. This storm is \"Pagan Dawn\", with <strong>Greg Fox's</strong> frantic drumming speeding up and slowing down (a masterful blend of technical ability that avoids sounding robotic or inauthentic) as the harmonies arc and <strong>Hunt-Hendrix's</strong> vocalsâ€”still the traditional blackened howlâ€”are somehow excited, joyous, and yearning. This is not a woeful yearning, but a yearning for some momentary \"yes,\" a \"yes\" through gritted, grinning teeth.  Those harmonic moments build into a brief  unaccompanied progression about a minute and half in, announcing the return of Fox's breakneck tempo-shifting rhythms, what Hunt-Hendrix calls the \"burst beat\". It is exactly that, a burst, a propulsive force, an impermanent acceleration away from black metal's cold dark interior. Liturgy is very frank in its desire to be musically transcendent, and cognizant as well that this transcendence is â€œ<em>an immanently generated mirage of transcendence, like a horizon or an asymptote</em>â€. They structure their songs to be ever-climbing beasts, fast and loud as hell. In the hands of any other group of musicians Side B would be called \"Pagan Dusk,\" a lament, a complacency with darkness and nihilism, a set pounding tempo with depressive shrieks and despondent riffage that might otherwise drone on for ten minutes. But Liturgy is not any other black metal band. The latter half of \"Pagan Dawn\" almost recalls this monotony as it breaks down into a plodding, methodical mid-tempo march, as though walking with black metal of old for a little while, placating it, challenging it. And then Greg Fox launches into yet another ever quickening burst beat, <strong>Bernard Gann</strong> and Hunter Hunt-Hendrix build a towering harmony on guitars underwritten by bassist <strong>Tyler Dusenbury</strong>. It is elating and rich and it resolves and retreats as suddenly as it began, having only skimmed the horizon.\r\n\r\nA few years ago my obsession with black metal began. I was in my dorm room in the middle of the night, forcing myself through Ulver's seminal Nattens Madrigal. \"Hynme VI: Wolf and Passion\" kicked in, and its soaring opening was a revelationâ€”it was sincere and affirmative and fleeting, and it died eventually into diametric, ominous verse. But that opening moment was a crystallization of the idea that extreme metal, and even black metal, is only extreme in its cacophony, and to some extent its postured conjuring of \"darkness,\" sometimes a jejune and silly \"darkness\" at that.  It was a realization that there could be emotional nuance in the most extreme metal, that it was serious, that this was a joyful seriousness, that it was art. <strong>Liturgy</strong> is a re-affirmation of this notion. And maybe, reading all this, it still seems ridiculous to you. A symposium on black metal \"theory\"? A band with a dense conceptual underpinning? But again, I am addressing you: the serious, disciplined listener of music. And I'd hazard to say that you listen to music because its expression of the ineffable is deeply resonant on a wide spectrum of emotional, intellectual, and (maybe) spiritual levels. It is a medium to transmit what mere words or mere images cannot alone express. Black metal has long broadcast a very particular expression: deep sorrow and depression, an intellectual longing for a pagan pre-history (and often the \"darkness\" or \"evil\" that is intentionally conjured is conjured to show us that these emotions and concepts are only connotative in such ways in the wake of Judeo-Christian tradition). If anything, the emotions and this idea of \"darkness,\" silly or not, are things we typically try to tuck away and hide, and so it is in a sense a genre that is hidden and tucked away. What is exciting is to see a band attempt to forcibly remove a genre from its cave and expose it mercilessly to the light, a band who takes its lineage seriously and decides to actively do something with it, something truly experimental, American, and ultimately uplifting. Liturgy is taking the sound of black metal's past and asking it to express something unique and new while still remaining secular, musically destructive, and chaotic. It's alchemy, really, an almost contradictory dark positivity.\r\n\r\nThe following appeared recently in a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/arts/music/15metal.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=3&amp;emc=eta1\">New York Times article about the \"Hideous Gnosis\" symposium:</a>\r\n<blockquote><em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">During a Q. and A. period Mr. Hunt-Hendrix was challenged by Scott Wilson, a professor from Lancaster University, [â€¦] Mr. Wilson wondered, skeptically, if transcendentalist black metal just boiled down to â€œall you need is love.â€</span>\r\n</em>\r\n\r\nâ€œI'm not so interested in defending anything I say,â€ Mr. Hunt-Hendrix replied. â€œI only like to be judged on whether it's interesting or not.â€</blockquote>\r\nSo whatever your entry on black metal looks like now, it ought to include at least a sentence on <strong>Liturgy</strong>, whether you see them as standard-bearers or visionaries, noodling hipsters or serious musicians. All they ask of you is what you ought always to be giving as a serious listenerâ€”your interest.\r\n\r\n<strong>Liturgy's</strong> full length album <strong>Renihilation</strong> is available <a href=\"http://www.phantomcityrecords.net/store/product_info.php?products_id=458&amp;osCsid=1a0f0f6b812edba92e35cf328942efe5\">here</a> from 20 buck spin.

Where you at all aware of the disparate incarnations of U.S. Black Metal, which are alike, if at all, in that they are one man, multi-instrumentalist \"hordes\" (I'm thinking of Xasthur, Leviathan, Wrath of the Weak) I think you've mentioned in some interviews that you were more interested in sort of the second-wave of black metal (Mayhem,  Immortal, Ulver, etc),  what was it that attracted you to these bands? As well, where did your musical interest lie outside of black metal, or perhaps more specifically, why was it this sort of music you gravitated towards when Liturgy first began?</strong>\r\n\r\nI've never listened to much USBM, with the exception of a few records by Xasthur or Judas Iscariot.  Certainly the second wave in Scandinavia was the black metal I first got into (Darkthrone, Ildjarn, early Emperor), though gradually my interest veered towards continental Europe - France and Poland particularly, I think.  Some of my favorites: Graveland, Vlad Tepes, Satanic Warmaster, Mutiilation, Blut Aus Nord, Warloghe, Haemoth.  Around the same time I was also getting way into post-romantic classical music, which is in a way similarly cryptic and esoteric because no one cares about it or respects it: Scriabin, Bruckner, Nielsen, Sibelius.  I think I began to kind of fuse the two traditions in my mind - both because there really are certain concrete musical similarities, but also because there is a similar nostalgic, grandiose, esoteric vibe.  Sibelius is the crossover in a way.  He was Norwegian, first of all, and his musical style was totally reactionary and antimodern.  Even though he was aware of Schoenberg and Bartok etc. he stuck to his Romantic vibe almost desperately.  Somehow to me Graveland and Sibelius have a similar aura.  But I was also getting into euro-avant-garde stuff, particularly Xenakis, Ligeti, Grisey, Stockhausen, etc. etc.  And for that matter, more than anything else, I was studying continental philosophy: Deleuze, Badiou, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Schopenhaur.  I was in school for philosophy at the time that I was developing Liturgy, and that was actually my main concern.   Anyway all of this seemed so faraway and magical, and to me black metal, post-romanticism, avant-garde contemporary classical music and continental philosophy seemed deeply connected --  which maybe in reality is isn't, at least not to the degree that it is in my imagination.  I dunno, it's hard to explain.  The music on this side of the Atlantic that I was most down with was minimalism/postminimalism, like Reich, La Monte Young, Charlemagne Palestine, up to Glenn Branca, and also My Bloody Valentine, though I also listened to a ton of hardcore like Orchid, pg. 99, Coverge, City of Caterpillar.  But that stuff felt very familiar.  I guess Liturgy was born of a desire to inject all the European culture that seemed so auratic and faraway into the tradition that I felt more a part of, and link it all to under the umbrella of the signifier \"Transcendentalism\" associated with Emerson etc.\r\n\r\n<strong>How did Bernard, Tyler and Greg get involved with Liturgy? Was it always the plan to expand the project into a fully-formed band? Is there a common affinity for extreme metal amongst the band, or is there more of an interest in the music at hand?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt wasn't always the plan to turn Liturgy into a full band, or to even really end up with a rock band necessarily.  I was really deep into philosophy and composition, and I bet five years ago I might have told you that Liturgy would end up being almost the negative image of what it is - that it, it would have been postminimalist composition that was inflected by black metal on the one hand and by Nietzsche and Wagner on the other hand.  The \"burst beat\" concept was always of crucial importance.  After Immortal Life, I spent a lot of time trying to take it to the next level, working on Xenakis-inspired stochastic generators to create chaotic and fluctuating electronic blast beats using Max/MSP.  But I was never quite satisfied with tending in that direction.  Partly because I love composing harmonies and melodies, and harmony and melody is precisely what avant-garde composition cuts out.  I was in a real crisis with this and finally decided to try it in rock band format, even if it wouldn't be so cerebral or sophisticated.  Greg, Bernard and Tyler all went to school together and knew one another, though I knew Greg and Bernard independently.  Bernard shares my interest in classical music and he joined the band first.  We played one show together as a duo, then Greg came along and brought Tyler with him.  It all came together super quickly; it was much less work that what I'd been trying to do, and I already had a million songs.  I think everyone in the band likes metal more or less, but probably that's what binds us together the least.  I don't think anyone in the band is like actively seeking out new metal to listen to.  Our interests are all a little different, and they're all elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<strong>Also, is Greg mimicking the tempo shifts of the drum machine from the solo Liturgy recordings? The speeding up/slowing down of the percussion throughout the album is incredible.</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, exactly!  On Immortal Life I'd just modulate the tempo with a knob, but that was just a sketch of the vision I had in mind.  The Max/MSP experiments sounded stupid, but working with Greg was immediately very rewarding.  A live drummer can't accelerate and decelerate with the same continuity that a machine can, but he can cross thresholds from one tempo another; it's pretty simple but very visceral and satisfying.  That's the essence of the burst beat.   Basically we worked out three \"tempos\" or patterns really, and he switches between the three at key harmonic moments.  And there are certain moments with true accelerations, though it doesn't really work in this context to be doing that all the time.\r\n\r\n<strong>What role did Colin Marston [of Krallice and Beholdâ€¦ The Arctopus] have in the recording process for Renihilation? How did he get involved in the recording ?</strong>\r\n\r\nHe's recorded many of my friends' bands, so he was an obvious go-to for this.  It was nice working with him, because he knows all about how to make metal sound heavy in a traditional way, but also is aware of other kinds of aesthetics, so it was the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\n<strong>Though Krallice and Liturgy are sonically distinct, it is interesting to see a black metal presence in New Yorkâ€”do you see a sort of community developing out of this (I don't want to suggest a \"scene\" since that word now carries a lot of connotations) in the same way there has always been art-influence punk and experimental music in the city? Do you have hopes for what  \"black metal' can become outside of Liturgy?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, I'm very interested in the future of black metal in America.  I think it should be called Transcendental Black Metal and it should channel and renew the spirit of liberation, and it should consume everything that's out there and reterritorialize it on the basis of a vision of apocalyptic ecstasy.\r\n\r\n<strong>I'm fascinated by the  anti-nihilist/transcendental content of the music. Do you have any literary/philosophical interests that have had an influence on composition? (Pagan Dawn, as a title, reminds me of Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals and the idea of the revaluation of values, for whatever reason)</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, I have a very deep interest in Nietzsche.  Good call.  The revaluation of values, the \"no\" to nihilism and the Zarathustran affirmation make up the fundamental kernel from which the music of Liturgy radiates.  Black metal has always been Nietzschean - often pretty explicitly, but usually it is the vulgar, fascist, racist Nazi reading of Nietzsche; I want to take what's already there and reinscribe it on the basis of the more subtle, contemporary and profound Deleuzian reading of Nietzsche, which comes down ultimately to Affirmation.  Actually I like to think of the old school of \"Hyberborean Black Metal\" as occupying the position of Nihilism in the Genealogy of Morals... Nihilism is a \"No\" to the priest, but it produces a soul that is even sicker than that of the Christian.  The Renihiliation is the final \"No\", the \"No\" to Nihilism which is Zarathustran affirmation.  The last connection I'll make to Nietzsche is:  I take very seriously the idea of the experimenter who tries on different cultures and value systems like different cloaks, and then revaluates them and generates an individual culture/system-of-values for himself.  That's why it's important to me for Liturgy to be standing in the void, at this crossroads between the \"black metal kvlt\", \"hipster culture\", \"serious music\", etc. which there's been some controversy over.  To not accept any herd, to not live inside a cultural paradigm but to smash different paradigms together and forge something out of the fragments....  so that's not an influence on the composition exactly, but on like the total aesthetic vision so to speak.\r\n\r\n<strong>There is an oscillation on Renhilation between the untitled tracks and the percussion driven, more metal-driven (for lack of a better term) tracks on the album (and the two we've chosen for the 7-inch). Is there a conceptual motivation for this? For instance, the first track's two minutes of tranquil droning vocals transitions effortlessly into the sensory overload of blastbeat and guitars in \"Pagan Dawn\". Is there an intellectual dichotomy being explored here above a purely musical one?</strong>\r\n\r\nWell, the untitled vocal track develops by adding progressively higher partials from the overtone series - the overtone series of course being a major theme in a lot of the music I've been talking about.  Maybe starting the record off in that way was an effort to situate the black metal sounds in that schema.  But really more than anything, though the concern was musical.  I thought it would sound great, musically compelling on the most intuitive level,  to set up pagan dawn with a progressively growing vocal drone.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Pagan Dawn\" has a real sense of urgency to it, even in the blissful tremolo harmony about a minute and a half in. Urgency runs throughout the album but is most prevalent I think on that track particularly. I've thought of that urgency in terms of the yearning for transcendence and the sort of reality that you seem to be only ever approaching it as a person, as though transcendence or spiritual ecstasy is an asymptote. Do you feel that the music itself contains that transcendental power, or that it is a best representation of what that transcendence could be, that it is merely work towards that idea?</strong>\r\n\r\nHa, yes the figure of the asymptote looms very large in my imagination actually.  The transcendence in question is a sort of immanently generated mirage of transcendence, like a horizon or an asymptote.  The \"Almost...\", the eternal \"not yet\", the goal that hangs in the sky etc.  I think we are touching upon something very fundamental to human experience, or at least to my personal experience.  Of course this is also known as the Void and as the Gap.  I think that Alain Badiou has put together a very exciting universalized philosophy of the Void.  One has to listen to it and remain faithful to it, and even though there's nothing to reach, nevertheless something changes and new things are born.  Something like that.  So Liturgy is a transmission of an experience of fidelity to the void.  I mean the vision that generates Liturgy is itself a sort of horizonal Transcendental Idea; ultimately it does not hang together, it doesn't cohere, but with enough fidelity it takes on a life of its own...\r\n\r\n<strong>I'm interested in the lo-fi quality, is there a balance you try to reach with recording quality (a point when you'd say \"this is too little fidelity\")? Did new ideas come across now that you have a group of musicians who perhaps bring different qualities to the table? Anything you might like to say about these tracks or in general (especially to a readership who probably listens to some noise but to whom black metal is some foreign entity)?</strong>\r\n\r\nI like a raw sound, but I also want everything to be pretty audible.  That's why Colin was good to work with.  He understands that a raw aesthetic doesn't \"sound bad\" but also was able to produce one without sacrificing actual fidelity.  The one thing I'll mention about Pagan Dawn specifically is that the bridge section with the slower beat is supposed to be a sort of blast beat in slow motion.  I'm very interested in the way that the mind relates to different tempos - like how a continuous thud at a very fast speed is a whir, but if it goes slow enough your whole body begins to throb and groove with it.  That was clearer on the demos, because I just toggled the tempo to make it slower.  Yes, for the new record we're doing a lot of work to focus on the ways that my ideas resonate with the other members and trying to channel that.  Bernard is an incredibly virtuosic guitar player, so that's something to work with.  Greg and I have produced a live version of the burst beat that has aspects that are particular to him, that weren't anticipated in advance, so we're trying to flesh that out.  Tyler's been showing me a bunch of Aka Pygmy chanting which we're going to incorporate into the new record.",

Even brief moments of dissonance can be distracting (occasionally one gets the feeling that they are intentional distractions from poor songwriting) or come off as forced, an insincere attempt to make a band sound more interesting or difficult than they really are.Â  It requires a remarkably gentle touch to make dissonances and rhythmic quirks not only slip by without disrupting the song, but actually lock in and sound as if they are essential and natural, and this is, in fact, just the thing <strong>Tavo Carbone</strong> of Brooklyn's <strong>Horse's Mouth</strong> excels at.\r\n\r\n<strong>Carbone's</strong> songs are short and restless, full of small idiosyncrasies and twitches (beats added or missing, lush vocal harmonies appearing and disappearing just as fast, tempos that lurch and accelerate).Â  You may feel like you've had your fill of idiosyncratic Brooklyn rock bands (lord knows I get that feeling sometimes), but the members of <strong>Horse's Mouth</strong> are probably not quite what you are picturing after that description.Â  There is nothing irritatingly or safely cool about them.Â  Horse's Mouth is actually refreshingly and genuinely nerdy.Â  In live videos, they are mostly clad in white t-shirts and jeans and Carbone himself sports an unassuming Monkees-style bowl cut, opening his mouth cartoonishly wide and bowing his head to hit the lowest notes.Â  After all, the band draws as much influence from showtunes (bear with me) and classical music as they do from the staples of indie pop.Â  Their Ampeater <strong>B-side â€œThin Branches Against a Windowâ€</strong> actually ends with a loop from a familiar-sounding orchestral piece.\r\n\r\nA Brooklyn native, <strong>Carbone</strong> met his bandmates, drummer <strong>J.J. Beck</strong>, bassist <strong>Matt Scott</strong>, violinist <strong>Heather Sommerlad</strong>, and multi-instrumentalist <strong>Michael Chinworth</strong>, at Bennington College, a school in Vermont that has produced other Ampeater favorites like <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem022\">Trevor Wilson (AEM022)</a> and <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem070\">Will Stratton (AEM70)</a>.Â  Carbone actually has quite a lot in common with Wilson, from his tightly coiled vibrato and theatrical delivery to his compositional and conceptual ambition.Â  The members of <strong>Horse's Mouth</strong> have been playing Carbone's songs together in various forms and with various other musicians since 2005 (including, at one point, a 17 piece orchestra), though Horse's Mouth as a band only officially dates back to 2008.Â  You can hear the chemistry between the musicians almost immediately upon listening, and especially on watching some of the live footage shot by Connor Kammerer andÂ <a href=\"http://pixelhorse.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixelhorse</a>.Â The live performances are impressively faithful to the record without losing any of the feeling of fun and spontaneity that comes from the itchy arrangements.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œIn the Woodsâ€</strong> (both songs in today's single are drawn from the band's new album <strong>Sophia</strong>, which will be released later this month in CD and DVD form, the latter featuring original films made by 12 videographers, one for each song) opens with a sprightly picking figure on the electric and a drumbeat that matches the guitar's rhythmic accents precisely.Â  The verses each close with a lovely, harmonized â€œnot old enough to knowâ€, on the last word of which the vocals begin in a tense minor 7<sup>th</sup> before leaping up to catch and hang on a high falsetto harmony.Â  It's one of those effortless little moments of dissonance that provide the tension and release in <strong>Carbone's</strong> songs, rather than the usual gradual emotional crescendo thing, which is okay too, only significantly more expected.Â  Also notice the way the lovely spiraling violin figure that leads us into the instrumental verse is cast into bold by the drums brief disappearance, and the way the drums are called back by a handclap (the only one in the entire song).Â  The most unexpected moment of unease comes during the very last descending â€œknowâ€, where instead of resolving to the root, Carbone's vocal melody rolls down through perfect consonance before landing on the flat two, a half step up from the one of the final chord.Â  It's probably the most dissonant note you can sing over a minor chord, and it has an intensely disquieting effect as the last note of the whole song, especially the way Carbone coats it with pretty vibrato, as if it's the most beautiful note in the world.Â  Yet this is actually the very thing that sells it on the recording: it doesn't sound like it's an ugly note to him.Â  It sounds like the note that he wanted the song to end on.Â  On the album (which drops on March 20<sup>th</sup> and which I haven't heard in its entirety), each song is strung into the next, so perhaps this final tension is a way of moving into the next song.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œThin Branches Against a Window,â€ </strong>after a brief organ intro, again matches the rhythmic emphases of the guitar to the drum part, giving the song a lilting, dancy feel that unifies it with <strong>â€œIn the Woodsâ€</strong> somewhat, though this song is much more of an exercise in constant motion.Â  Before the first verse even starts, it careens off into a very brief sort of Deerhoof interlude, which pockmarks the song periodically, in which the tempo abruptly and completely changes and the drums play a couple of quick, skittering fills.Â  The song rarely stays in any one meter for more than a few bars, sticking mostly, but not entirely, to 4/4 during the verses and otherwise jumping around like a madman, a feeling that is countered only by the calm and stately violin parts.Â  After the one moment where everything coheres into what sounds as if it's going to be an actual chorus (repeating melody and lyric, 4/4 time, descending harmony), the meter changes and the violin and guitar spin out of control, everything clashing and then somehow resolving into what sounds like a loop from a Schubert record, which finally plays itself out into three acoustic guitar arpeggios and...the sound of a bird chirping?Â  It's an unbelievable amount of stuff crammed into less than three minutes, and when faced with it it's easy to overlook the loveliness of the chiming guitars and glockenspiels that underscore the verses.\r\n\r\nI've mentioned before how music that maintains its mystery is often far more effective, and <strong>Carbone </strong>does exactly that here, giving us lyrics oblique enough to mean a great many things and music that skates through so many moods and meters and feels that it's hard to say just what exactly makes it feel coherent, though certainly something does.Â  Perhaps it's the common sounds of each member's voice (they all sing, excluding <strong>Beck</strong>, the drummer), or the distinctly personal style each has on his or her instrument.Â  Perhaps it's that all <strong>Horse's Mouth</strong> songs feel odd in precisely the same way, the product of Carbone's unique and unified vision, impossible to pin down completely but evocative and pleasurably strange, like a fairytale landscape (not one of the neutered ones where everyone is nice and boring, but the Hans Christian Andersen kind, where little girls get their feet cut off with axes).\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe

Remember the 4-track hullabaloo in the 90s? Didnâ€™t matter if the music was the most god awful shit ever produced--if it was churned out on one of those cheap Aiwa 4-track recorders, then it deserved a listen. Now finally the twenty-first century has its own trend: cassette rock! Fashions of this sort can be fairly hit-or-miss. If the bandsâ€™ style of delivery doesnâ€™t mesh with the style of production, the whole approach can come off as a misfire. Do you really want to hear Dark Side of the Moon redone on four tracks? Or how about Leadbelly in a twenty million dollar studio? If the shoe doesnâ€™t fit, you canâ€™t wear it. Luckily for <strong>Girlfriends</strong> the shoe fits just right. There is something about the cheeky, cheapo fun of tapes that captures their approach perfectly. There is a cream to every crop, and cassette rock may have found its very first keeper in Girlfriends.\r\n\r\nThe band out of Boston wastes no time on stylistic curlicues in their compositions. Fuzzed-out, stomp-boxed 60s power pop melodies grab you in the first few seconds and donâ€™t let go. The songs are short, direct, noisy- and thatâ€™s exactly how the trio of <strong>Ben Potrykus</strong> (guitar), <strong>Jen Dowty</strong> (bass) and <strong>Andy Sadoway</strong> (drums) like it. Their first EP <strong>Our Very First Cassette</strong>, released late 2009, was a quick and dirty romp that got solid reviews from critics and tastemakers. Though the bandâ€™s approach sounds simple, thereâ€™s a complexity bubbling beneath the surface that holds your attention. The jagged guitar lines and off-the-cuff vocals are tossed off like the mad strokes of an action painter in full frenzy, while remaining confined within pop art superstructures. Imagine Jackson Pollack, drunk on corn whiskey, trying to copy Warholâ€™s soup cans: a superlative mess that nonetheless attains a certain iterative fascination. <strong>Girlfriends</strong> took a similar tack on the EP, trading on the listenerâ€™s familiarity with certain pop forms to introduce a decidedly unfamiliar savagery into the proceedings.  The song <em>â€œsuckin rare meat off the bone white chinaâ€</em> mixes whammied guitar, megaphone vocals, and some rough Beach Boysâ€™ harmonies into a beastly surf safari. â€œbites + scratchesâ€ captures Girlfriends in a more reflective, Pogues-mode, attempting to muster up a mood of good old-fashioned heartbreak. Itâ€™s a great song, but the heartbreak isnâ€™t entirely persuasive. The riffs are just too damn fun to frown over.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which <strong>Girlfriends</strong> traverses the pop register is a testament to their origins out of the roiling, moiling cauldron that is the Boston music scene. Discount booze and college kids aplenty keep the clubs filled while the insane 1am closing time of the subway preserves a niche for late night DIY house parties. The give and take between public and private forums sustains an occasionally inspired dialectic within the scene. <em>â€œ2004 was a formative year for me,â€</em> as <strong>Potrykus</strong> recalls, <em>â€œcos I started living in the city in late 2003 and I  saw and met Clickers and Night Rally and the Faux and the Mules and Dreamhouse and Neptune, and now Denial and, I think, Wildildlife (they were just 'Wildlife' then) and everyone was being really loud and noisy and splitting their time between basements and clubs, which I thought made things a lot more interesting.â€</em> Thatâ€™s quite a list of bands; but what artist can resist the louche allure of down-and-out of bohemian Boston, of Jamaica Plains, of Allston â€œRock City,â€ of Cambridge and Somerville? Breeding grounds, one and all, for raunchy rawk and fine purveyors (according to Potrykus) of <em>â€œauthentic south American food,â€</em> <em>â€œorganic fair trade markets,â€ â€œthrift storesâ€</em> and <em>â€œall that crap.â€</em> When <strong>Potrykus</strong>, <strong>Dowty</strong> and <strong>Sadoway</strong> arenâ€™t shopping for ethically-reared beef to mix into their picadinho de milho, the band members find time for other projects including Christians &amp; Lions and  Magma Divers- thatâ€™s a pretty full plate.\r\n\r\nFor their A-side, <strong>Girlfriends</strong> chose <strong>â€œGood To Be Trueâ€</strong> from their first EP <strong>Our Very First Cassette</strong>. Itâ€™s a straightforward Ramones-style ballad that has lived a few lives since the band recorded it late in 2009. On the first edition of the cassette, â€œGood To Be Trueâ€ starred an as-yet-unidentified â€œspace alien laserâ€ solo and might have been recorded in a shoebox. In the words of <strong>Sadoway</strong>, <em>â€œTapes sound like shit usually, am I right?â€</em> For the Ampeater 7-inch, Girlfriends gave the song a quick spitshine: bulking up the vocals, balancing the mix, and generally bringing the track up to the strenuous standards of a self-proclaimed <em>â€œgarbage power trio.â€</em> While the <em>â€œspace alien laserâ€</em> solo gets more or less dropped (youâ€™ll have to see the live show for that, or dig up a first edition cassette somewhere) the crisper mix targets two elements that makes Girlfriends great: sing along lyrics and simple song structures. The lyrics of â€œGood To Be Trueâ€ describe a downer narrative of teenage emotional insecurity, but the words are set to a bouncy, jangly riff that is so catchy itâ€™s impossible to brood.\r\n\r\nThe good vibes continue on the B-side with a cover of the Vaselinesâ€™ <strong>â€œThe Day I Was a Horse.â€</strong> Clocking in at a trim 1:39, the cover satisfies the bandâ€™s appetite and predilection for the short form. In fact, their longest song appears to be â€œI Was Here But I Disappearâ€ (3:22) from the EP. Commenting on the short form, <strong>Potrykus</strong> remarks, <em>â€œâ€¦so many good bands and people are into writing shorter songs again too- which I really like. Good two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half minute songs are hard to beat sometimes.â€</em> One notable master of the short form, the recently-passed Jay Reatard, appeared to be on the verge of reintroducing the mainstream to the unique possibilities of the short, sweet and simple. Whether brevity makes a comeback will depend on bands like Girlfriends reaching back to a time before bloated Bjorkestras became the apple of every indie musicianâ€™s eye. Seriously, how much time is required to relate the absurdity of â€œthe day I was a horseâ€? Even the Metamorphosis was a short story.\r\n\r\nWith the release of the second edition of their debut EP, <strong>Girlfriends</strong> has shown the beaten-up, old cassette format still holds some intrigue. Whether this heralds a triumphant return to the cassette in general (donâ€™t hold your breath) remains to be seen. The irony is, of course, that the Ampeater Review is releasing <strong>â€œGood To Be Trueâ€</strong> and <strong>â€œThe Day I Was a Horseâ€</strong> as digital pantomimes of a vinyl 7-inch. The world is topsy turvy with different ways to listen to music. The appeal of one specific format appears to be the same appeal of music subgenres: a sense of community, a sense of belonging, a sense of whatever-letâ€™s-party.\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s a slew of bands that have recently released work in the cassette format, like Quilt and Truman Peyote, and a ton more that are percolating within the same scene, including Kid Romance, Thick Shakes, Earthquake Party!, Young Adults, Maine Coons, and more. These are bands that play all different types of music- garage, electronic, folk, psychedelia- so there doesnâ€™t seem to be any coherent movement afoot. But one trait they do share is that theyâ€™re all putting together exciting new music that merits attention: really, what more could you ask for?\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mike Gutierrez</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - The Day I Was a Horse [audio:AEM075 Girlfriends/02 The Day I Was a Horse.mp3|titles=The Day I Was a Horse|artists=Girlfriends]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Good To Be True [audio:AEM075 Girlfriends/01 Good To Be True.mp3|titles=Good To Be True|artists=Girlfriends]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM075 Girlfriends.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

For example, what if you turned around right now and Bill Murray was in your bedroom, staring at you, eating an apple? You would probably remember that moment for the rest of your life, and it would certainly put a thrill into the rest of your day, if not your week or month. Think of all the conversations you would have about it (<em>â€œI have no idea how he got in! And then he just climbed out the window, never said a word!â€</em>), whereas if you turned around and found the pile of dirty clothes you left there yesterday, you wouldn't even remember that moment ten minutes later. This idea has stuck with me since then (it's not unlikely that I've mangled or misunderstood it in some way, but if so then it is now my idea) and it resonates with my experience of music as well as my experience of life. The music that always grips me in the most visceral and immediate way is the music that sounds impossible, that generates in me a feeling of joyful surprise. Sometimes it happens in straight-up pop music, if I hear a new three chord song that sounds so eternal and so unique I can't believe it wasn't already written decades ago, or an unconventional yet lovely chord progression or melody. More often it only lasts for a moment, a rhythmic hitch in the chorus of a song or one bar of sublime and strange harmony. These are the moments in pop songs I play back over and over again, but in other modes of composition, minus the familiar pop anchors, the feeling of being in wonderfully unfamiliar territory can last for far longer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Bing and Ruth</strong>, the compositional outlet for Brooklyn-based pianist <strong>David Moore</strong>, manages to reach and sustain this feeling of the impossible impressively well. His lovely, winding pieces manage to achieve some of the same hypnotic and otherworldly qualities as electric and electronic music despite the fact that they are built almost entirely out of acoustic textures (my first, probably simplistic, reaction to hearing Bing and Ruth was to think â€œacoustic Stars of the Lidâ€). The key to the otherworldliness in Moore's work is the combination of disparate instruments to form singular, unified sounds that seem entirely alien to the instruments we think we know so well. For example, there is a wash of sound in <strong>B-side â€œgo on.â€</strong> which sounds to me like clarinet, cello and bowed cymbals, but part of the beauty and the fun of the music is that it's very hard to tell just by listening what is making the strange sounds that you are hearing.\r\n\r\n<strong>Moore</strong> is also unafraid of allowing his music to unfold naturally and gradually, which accounts for the longer track times and the sense of luxurious pacing. Exploring for three minutes the sound of two clarinets slipping in and out of tune with one another with an aching slowness (as on the very start of <strong>â€œgo on.â€</strong>) is something that takes a bit of compositional bravery, but it more than pays off. As with much minimalism (this is, in fact, one of the points of Cage's often mocked â€œ4'33''â€, which causes the audience to listen not to silence but to the ambient and human sound in the concert hall), the simplicity and clarity of the ideas causes the audience to listen with an intense focus seldom given to music that dances and cavorts for attention. The sound of the accelerating and decelerating beats, generated by the two tones as they drift apart and then back together, is a fascinating and strange one, putting the focus not on the pitches of the two woodwinds but on the rhythms generated by their intonation differences (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28acoustics%29\" target=\"_blank\">Beats</a> are natural sound interference generated by two tones which are very close together but not quite in unison. They sound like a rhythmic swelling, almost like tremolo, the speed of which varies by how close the two tones are to one another). Around this locus, Moore gradually adds other instruments, culminating in the arrival of his piano, which plays a gentle, steady, three-chord pattern. Over this pattern there are fragments of lovely, melancholic piano melodies set against drones created by the intersection of bowed cymbals with bowed strings and analog synths with mellow clarinets, combining pitches and textures from different instruments into one sound that is unrecognizable and inimitable. The description may sound labored but the music is anything but. The effect is stunning, and it's only enhanced by the moments when you hear a human voice or a cello emerge with a clarity that's hauntingly brief. The way the song melts back into a single note at the very end (this time cello overtones and voice, I think) is a moment of delicate and perfect symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe <strong>A-side â€œRailsâ€</strong> drawn from the band's forthcoming <strong>City Lake</strong> album, begins with some Reichian clapping, overlapping different claves like puzzle pieces and then matching them with a piano figure that neatly parallels their rhythms. Like the much sparser piano figure in <strong>â€œgo on.â€</strong>, this serves as an anchor for the rest of the song and a springboard for overlapping vocal, string and reed melodies, which sit just far enough back in the mix that you have to really focus to draw them out. They always seem to dance away from your ear, and just as soon as you catch on to one it disappears and you find yourself suddenly drawn to a different melody. Nothing ever seems to repeat, and the song has a lightness to it that would almost make it sound improvised if it weren't so carefully woven together. It really ought to be said that the musicians who give life to <strong>Moore's</strong> pieces are immensely skillful and subtle (for those keeping score, or trying to discern various instruments, the lineup is as follows: <strong>Becca Stevens</strong>, Voice; <strong>Jean Rohe</strong>, Voice; <strong>Jeremy Viner</strong>, Clarinet; <strong>Patrick Breiner</strong>, Clarinet; <strong>Greg Heffernan</strong>, Cello; <strong>Leigh Stuart</strong>, Cello; <strong>Jeff Ratner</strong>, Acoustic Bass; <strong>Chris Berry</strong>, Percussion; <strong>Myk Freedman</strong>, Lap Steel; and <strong>Mike Effenberger</strong>, Analog Synth). Everything is in its right place, and all the sounds blend effortlessly together. Without such tightly, expertly controlled performances, the pieces could never reach their deeply textured heights.\r\n\r\nMy favorite moment in <strong>â€œRails,â€</strong> one which gives the listener a thrilling weightless feeling, is right around 4:20, when the floor tom and bass that have been with us for minutes suddenly drop out and a thick, clustered chord, composed of nearly every instrument in the band, swells and swells as if to burst. It's a fantastically tense moment, and when the bass and drum come back in it's with the same subtle part, understated as everything else in <strong>Moore's</strong> music, yet in context, buoying up that thick cloud of sound, it feels absolutely triumphant, like the biggest sound in the world.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - go on.

Otherwise, I might have never enjoyed <strong>The Hibernauts</strong>.  I still havenâ€™t quite figured out what it was.  I came into being a consumer of music from a steady diet of \"oldies 103.3\" outside philly, which is pretty much what my parents chose to have on in the car.  But when I became a modern music consumer, I skewed away from musical levity.  The first CD I got was Limp Bizkitâ€™s â€œSignificant Other.â€  The second was Powerman 5000.  Part of me feels the need to defend this, but whatever, I was like 12 years old.  I was young, kinda angry, and listened to bad nu-metal, and had little interest in <em>â€œfunâ€</em> music.  Even when young-me started skewing softer, it was to things like Low, Mogwai, etc., not party pop jams.  I think fun seemed substance-less?\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve changed though.  Iâ€™ve seen the funlight.  Thereâ€™s a hidden brilliance to good <em>â€œfun.â€ </em> Because of course, fun without any substance isnâ€™t really fun at all.  And yet that which is fun hides behind the countenance of, <em>â€œhey man, weâ€™re just hanging out.  No need to get serious in here.â€</em> But in that pure visceral enjoyment is a link to something very real and potentially lasting.  The music in the made-up-genre-Iâ€™m-calling-Fun lasts with us because it does something to us, like all music does, beyond just distracting us from traffic for 15 minutes.  What on earth does it do?\r\n\r\nFun, of course, is not the true subject of this review.  <strong>The Hibernauts</strong> are.  Hailing from Saint Louis, The Hibernauts are in the release period of their new album, <strong>Velvet Suit</strong>, their full length follow up to 2007â€™s <strong>Periodic Fable</strong>. Theyâ€™re a decidedly talented rock group who accomplish the increasingly rare feat of achieving an indie aesthetic while still exhibiting that yes, they can be precise with their writing and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nPushing play on <strong>A-side â€œIntermuralsâ€</strong> drops you right into the fun zone (which I imagine is similar to a Discovery Zone).  The major chords start a-rippinâ€™ and some jovial little note bends get your head bobbing.  Two seconds in, the beat kicks and this song is off to the races.  Weâ€™ve got lead singer/guitar play <strong>Tom McArthur</strong> oh-oh-ohhing through the verse.  Weâ€™ve got guitarist/vocalist<strong> Jack Stevens</strong> coming in from the left, Mr. <strong>Chad Rogers</strong> with a deceptively funky grove on that chorus kick, <strong>Bill Vehige</strong> on some light tinkly keys and Brett Ramsey driving the song forward with classic pop finesse.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œIâ€™m gonna put on my velvet suit.  Iâ€™m lyinâ€™, I donâ€™t have one, I think its fun.â€</em>\r\n\r\nVery astute, Song Lyrics.  It is fun.  Jesus, its fun.   The guitars wash in and out.  The bass scales up and down until clannggg, the pick scrapes and itâ€™s over.  But there is a human passion to the fun being had here, most musically apparent in the continual forward march of the drums and the schwika schwika wahhh guitars.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf you knew the fireâ€¦and the thunderâ€¦that I feel.â€\r\n\r\nYes!  Though the primary mood is fun, this song, and all successful funpop music retains its human essence.  I have trouble with things like, oh, letâ€™s say, Chromeo (why not?  I need an example), because sometimes I forget that thereâ€™s people making the music.  Precision is one thing, but take a Ratatatâ€”just as precise, but much more FUN and much more HUMAN; in fact, much more of both because of the other.  Much more fun-man.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Hibernauts</strong> never let you forget that there are five dudes playing this music.  Five dudes with beating hearts and maybe beards and possibly girlfriends, and apartments and bus passes and too many dishes in the sink.  This is my favorite thing about rock musicâ€”sometimes I like music because itâ€™s reaches an inhuman place, inhumanly smooth, inhumanly vicious, inhumanly robotic, but rock music is music made by people you can instantly imagine with itchy faces and nylon stringed acoustic guitars in the corner of their tiny 4 person apartment, just like me, just like you. (Ok, Iâ€™m lying, I donâ€™t have one.  But I think itâ€™s funâ€¦)\r\n\r\nI like this thesis because I think the <strong>B-side â€œVillainâ€</strong> supports and strengthens it even though, at face value, it should undermine this little party Iâ€™ve got going here. But follow me anyways.  â€œVillainâ€ is not a party title.  And the song is gentle.  It has an emotional edge to it.  It uses a robot for beats.  Thereâ€™s some slow keys.  Oh, and strings, strings canâ€™t be fun, right?  Strings are in orchestras, and those are very serious.  But something awesome happened after I heard this song, oh, I donâ€™t know ten times.  I started having an awful lot of fun.  The low organ three-note progression is deceivingly groovy.  And sorry, Hibernauts, but thatâ€™s a catchy chorus!  You cannot escape!  Itâ€™s soft and mellow and the lyrics are you lied! But gosh darnit if that isnâ€™t a fun lick!  I feel almost guilty getting a little groove on to this song, but when you can write songs and craft melodies, thatâ€™s what happens, even when the mood is tempered.\r\n\r\nLook, we love music.  And when we hear humanity in it, we have a bit of fun.  Listening to sad songs is, underneath the surface, kind of fun.  I think a lot of the times people forget that when they just set out to <em>â€œrock.â€</em> No one wants to hear you just <em>â€œrockâ€</em> because, geologically speaking, that sucks.  You need to convince us that youâ€™re just rocking, while actually doing more.  The whole rock and roll imagery is built into this deceptionâ€”the carefully arranged cover shots of everyone looking super casual, the million dollar videos of the guitar player just doing, â€œwhatever he feels.â€  This is why rock and roll is difficult; this is why rock and roll is more fun than Chromeo (no hard feelings, dudes).  This is why rock and roll is American and this is why rock and roll really isnâ€™t going anywhere.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Hibernauts</strong> clearly understand all this, to the point that even when they arenâ€™t rocking out, the lessons theyâ€™ve learned are still present.  Being fun is serious business people.  Now, doff your hats and commence the rocking.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Rick Andrews</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Villain [audio:AEM077 The Hibernauts/02 Villain.mp3|titles=Villain|artists=The Hibernauts]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Intermurals [audio:AEM077 The Hibernauts/01 Intermurals.mp3|titles=Intermurals |artists=The Hibernauts]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM077 The Hibernauts.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

In the chorus, the topic turnsÂ  to love.Â  Somehow these themes of a hopeless economy and a love based entirely on hopeâ€”<em>â€œin in a perfect world we would beâ€</em>â€”become intertwined, and I even get the impression that one could be a metaphor for the other, although I couldn't say which is which.Â  At any rate, you don't need money to dance and Â  â€œLost Generationâ€ makes that abundantly clear.\r\n\r\n<strong>Chandler</strong> recorded his first EP <strong>Lost Generation</strong> in a couple of years back when he was toying with the term â€œ<em>ukulindie</em> <em>rockâ€</em> as a way to describe his music and indeed ukulele features very prominently on the album.Â  However, since then he's broadened his reach a bit and weaned himself off that genreÂ  classification.Â  <em>â€œ I didn't want to be always making the uke my principle song writing instrument because I don't want it to become a gimmick for me or anything. I only ever use it to enhance my songs, never because I'm creating an image.â€ </em> It's a fair distinction.Â  <em>â€œThe main reason I love the uke,â€</em> he adds, <em>â€œis because it brightens and disguises songs that would otherwise be too dark for my liking without it.â€ </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œHuman Unkindâ€</strong> is one of those songs.Â  You can probably glean from the title that it's going to be oppressively dismal, and the lyrics deliver as advertised.Â  But because the main riff is played on ukulele instead of, say, the guitar, the entire song sounds lighter.Â  It also helps that the arrangement is fairly sparse.Â  Without drums to drown things out, each instrument can be heard as distinct which is especially nice because â€œHuman Unkindâ€ is full of intricacies like the small crashes that occur on the upbeat and ornate guitar figures.Â  My favorite moment is at around 1:57 when the progression unexpectedly resolves on a major chord and Chandler's angelic harmonies kick in like a ray of sunlight piercing the clouds.Â  A similar moment occurs at around 3:17 and by that point it feels a little like a chorus, although the resolution is so brief that I hesitate to call it so.Â  Perhaps refrain is a better choice.Â  Unlike <strong>â€œLost Generationâ€</strong> which exhibits strong pop sensibilities, â€œHuman Unkindâ€ follows a more experimental form.\r\n\r\n<strong>Galapaghost</strong> is weathering the recession quite well, and may in fact expand soon.Â  <strong>Chandler</strong> has begun performing at clubs and bars around NYC (where he lives) and plans to gather a band so that he may reproduce the sounds on his recordings in a live setting.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Human Unkind [audio:AEM078 Galapaghost/02 Human Unkind.mp3|titles=Human Unkind|artists=Galapaghost]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Lost Generation [audio:AEM078 Galapaghost/01 Lost Generation.mp3|titles=Lost Generation|artists=Galapaghost]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM078 Galapaghost.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Comparisons were thrown out likening the Boston-based quartet to the Pixies, Pavement, and Joanna Newsom. The local press, from the Boston Phoenix, to CMJ, to QRO Magazine, tabbed them as a band to keep an eye on. Not bad for a few BU students on the verge of graduation. Since then the band has been mixing bouts of touring with time in the studio, assembling a much anticipated raft of new material.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s no mistake that <strong>You Can Be A Wesley</strong> often receives comparisons to the indie rock legends from the 90s. The band revisits a time when guitar was still the undisputed king-of-the-ring. <strong>Heard Like Us</strong><em> </em>saunters, sprints and strolls through a postpunk landscape where the spartan simplicity of the standard-issue punk arsenal is highlighted with a few bells and whistles to achieve a more country, folky coloring. You Can Be A Wesley can sound brash and raw when they want to, as they do on the riveting climax of <strong>â€œCreatures.â€</strong> <strong>Saara Untracht-Oakner</strong> and <strong>Winston Macdonald</strong> know how to make a guitar scream, while <strong>Nick Curran</strong> (bass) and <strong>Dan Goldenberg</strong> (drums) can pelt the listener with some aggressive rhythms when they want to. But the most characteristic moments of the album come in songs like â€œWildlife,â€ â€œKiddie Poolâ€ and â€œMake Up Your Godâ€ where the band takes a more contemplative and (comparatively) quieter approach to their subject matter. Like Pavement, You Can Be A Wesley can rearrange the abrasive textures of a punk inheritance to craft songs that leave behind the easy confrontational attitudes of adolescent chutzpah for more uncertain, more mature, and more perplexed territory. <strong>Heard Like Us</strong>, recorded with J. Mendocino (of Pretty and Nice), used a few unconventional means to coax some strange flavors out of the music. Untraacht-Oakner recalls the odder instrumentation choices: <em>â€œWe used some keyboards, melodica (â€œRearrange the Seaâ€), random percussion things including banging on books and couches.Â  There's a bunch of layers in some parts that make it really interesting sonically but it all blends in well so that it's not very obvious.â€</em>\r\n\r\nComplementing the instrumentation are lyrics that mix the trivial with the profound. The inspired juxtaposition is so absurd as to be true to life. Consider the track â€œFourth Wallsâ€, which lifts its title from reality TV jargon, the so-called â€˜fourth wallâ€™ that separates the self-important D-level role players from the writers, producers, and crew whose job it is to record the drunken shenanigans for posterity. The â€˜fourth wallâ€™ is the constantly compromised dividing line between real and the surreal, the hyphen between â€˜realityâ€™ and â€˜TVâ€™, for characters like Gary Coleman and Omarosa. But for you and me, the â€˜fourth wallâ€™ is that dividing line between our own subjective hopes, dreams and estimations of the world, on the one hand, and an impersonal birdâ€™s eye view of the world that always threatens to annihilate our pretensions. Life seems to be a continual feud between these two halves, a predicament into which we are all tirelessly plunged. Grim stuff; but slowly building riffs and sweet progressions of â€œFourth Wallsâ€ remind us that there is beauty even in struggle, and that for every storm there is a quiet afterwards.\r\n\r\n<strong>You Can Be A Wesley</strong> makes music that rewards relistening. You may like a song immediately, but not be able to figure out what excited your fancy until youâ€™ve become more familiar with its twists and turns. A quick twangy line from the lead guitar, a naked walking bass, a percussive flourish: youâ€™ll find pleasant surprises scattered like colorful easter eggs all through their songs. You Can Be A Wesley has a gift for the light compositional touch, the sort of off-the-cuff invention not usually written down or even discussed, that is characteristic of bands with a lot more experience. If there is one bold element that will grab you right away, however, itâ€™s the standout vocals of <strong>Untracht-Oakner</strong>. Sheâ€™s concocted a strange alchemy in her delivery, impressive in its range and depth. There are the pixy strains of Joanna Newsom in â€œKiddie Poolâ€, the folk bansheeisms of Margaret Darling (of Seedy Seeds) on â€œWildlifeâ€, and occasionally she hits an old skool riot grrrl howl Ã  la Kathleen Hanna (literally â€œold skoolâ€- Hanna just donated her collected papers, â€˜zines, letters to New York University- is she planning to die soon?). Without sounding like a copy, sheâ€™s managed to cull the best of all their qualities into a truly ennervating hybrid.\r\n\r\nFor the A-side, <strong>Untracht-Oakner</strong> pushes her vocals all the way up to eleven. The Boston press fell in love with <strong>â€œCreaturesâ€</strong> when it came out as the single for <strong>Heard Like Us<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">.</span></strong> The track begins with a quiet xx-esque bassline, bouncy drums, and talky vocals before upshifting into a banshee-howling chorus. Itâ€™s the old loud/quiet/loud manouevre that drew so many comparisons to the Pixies. The memorable climax was the result of some experimental tomfoolery in the studio: <em>â€œThere's a part in Creatures,â€ </em>Untracht-Oakner remembers,<em> â€œwhere my vocals had a robot type effect on them.Â  That was really funny when we were recording it.Â  Jeremy would also just twist knobs on our pedals as we were playing parts and some really cool sounds came out of that.â€</em> Who knows if Black Francis would have tolerated someone toying with the knobs while he sang (probably not), but maybe he should have, because the sustained 6-measure howl is one of the most unforgettable moments of the album.\r\n\r\nThe <strong>B-side â€œSummerhomesâ€</strong> is one of <strong>You Can Be A Wesleyâ€™s</strong> old favorites. <strong>Untracht-Oakner</strong> recalls its genesis: <em>â€œSummerhomes is from our first 3 song demo that we gave out at shows which included \"Gravity\" and \"Fire It Off\".Â  We recorded it with our friend Alex McKneely in his apartment in Allstonâ€¦Winston wrote that first guitar part and was looping it with a pedal and playing slide over it.Â  This is back in winter 2007.Â  Winston taught me how to play the main riff and I think I went home that night and wrote lyrics immediately.â€</em> The track is a quieter, more reflective number: an acoustic, finger-picky meditation with a pretty-as-a-picture slide guitar. The lyrics hit their peak of poignancy with the line<em> â€œWe found out how weâ€™ll die/So we all bought summerhomes in the sky.â€</em> Not the sort of sentiment that is going to spark a proletarian revolution, but true to life nonetheless. You Can Be A Wesley reserves it for special occasions: <em>â€œIt has to be the right moodâ€¦we don't want to bring people down if they just want to dance and get wild.â€</em>\r\n\r\nNo longer Bostonâ€™s best-kept-secret, <strong>You Can Be A Wesley</strong> have been previewing new material at shows all up and down the east coast and into Canada. <strong>Untracht-Oakner</strong> reports on the status of the new songs (but keeps mum on release dates): <em>â€œâ€¦we have a bunch of songs we've been playing live and then a bunch that are in the works and almost done and a few ideas here and there for other things.Â  We've got a full album's worth of material on it's way.â€</em> On the direction of the new songs: <em>â€œA lot of the new songs rock pretty hard.Â  We're definitely getting into some louder stuff and just trying to keep it fun and interesting. There are a couple songs in the works that are more sway-ie than dance-ie but will still punch you in the face.â€</em> Sway-ie, dance-ie, but will still punch you in the face. Figure out how to make music like that and You Can Be A Wesley too.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mike Gutierrez</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Summerhomes [audio:AEM079 You Can Be A Wesley/02 Summerhomes.mp3|titles=Summerhomes|artists=You Can Be A Wesley]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Creatures [audio:AEM079 You Can Be A Wesley/01 Creatures.mp3|titles=Creatures|artists=You Can Be A Wesley]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM079 You Can Be A Wesley.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Bannered over a couple of mangled, post-traumatic automobiles juxtaposed weirdly onto a pink-skied, muddy plantation is the text: <strong><em>BONG KONG</em></strong><em>â€¦at the Dock Ellis Home for the Chronically On Acid</em>. Underneath the date and address at the bottom of the flyer it says: <em>9PM Until Youâ€™re Fucked</em>. <em>Donâ€™t be a douchebag â€“ bring booze</em>. The next clue should be the comprehensive sticker bundle that comes in a Bong Kong CD EP package. Thereâ€™s one of a lemon answering a portable phone, another of a kitten with a rainbow beaming across its eyes and a third of a bleak, dusty, Cormac McCarthy-esque landscape littered with dead cowboys. Clearly, Bong Kongâ€”a super loud, super fun, guitar (<strong>Kris Tyas</strong>) and drums (<strong>Eric Lisausky</strong>) thrash duo from Phillyâ€”take their goofiness seriously.\r\n\r\nThe party that night was as surreal as the flyer that promoted it. Upstairs, <strong>Kris</strong> and <strong>Eric</strong> passed out CDsâ€”their 4-song, barely 10-minute debut EP, <strong>Do Not Play in Reverse</strong>â€”and promotional <strong>Bong Kong</strong> $2 billsâ€”impressively photoshopped, authentic looking bills with Lisauskyâ€™s mug substituting for a dead president on the front and cat heads replacing those of the nationâ€™s founding fathers signing the Declaration on the back. As the opening bands rotated on and off the stage in the basement and the drinks became debris on the porch outside, Bong Kong separated itself from the affair for a brief moment. Facing one another, they tapped beers, exchanged the Letâ€™s Do This look and told each other, <em>â€œhoods up.â€</em> When they finally took the stage downstairs (after a set from local Levittown â€œlegend,â€ 40-oz. Pimpâ€”a shirtless, tat-covered white rapper who lugged around a handle of Jim Beam all night and performed a sparsely attended set that was as uncomfortable as it was horrible), Bong Kong flipped the hoods of their sweatshirts up and flicked on a strobe light sitting atop the Marshall stack. The resultâ€”a breakneck set of riffs and yelps that lasted 15 minutes, generouslyâ€”was nothing short of mesmerizing. It may not have looked it from the back of the 25-or-so capacity space, but the view from the front was instant proof that these dudes are ready for disciples.\r\n\r\nBut <strong>Bong Kong</strong> never lets you go too long without realizing that this is supposed to be fun. True, their sound is almost entirely inaudible shrieks, lightning-quick drums and heavy, heady, hyperactive stoner riffs, but to dismiss it as challenging or grave would be foolish. Check the lyric sheet. <strong>Tyas</strong> is singing about cute bunnies rising up against a drunken farmer (<strong>â€œFunny Bunniesâ€</strong>) or earning the high score on an arcade game (<strong>â€œI Make Changeâ€</strong>), in the latter cleverly feigning seriousness when he rants â€œ<em>the day will come when you all know my name</em>.â€ Itâ€™s dark, dark humorâ€”in the purest of forms. And donâ€™t confuse their irony with that of a thrift store vest jacket or a three-week old mustache. Theirs is smart and confident like a Kurt Vonnegut novel, or a cartoon about nuclear war. Sure, there will be those who wince and cup their ears, but theyâ€™re not â€œgetting itâ€ and need to have a few more drinks. <em>â€œAnd you can dance to it but you have to try pretty hard,â€</em> adds Tyas.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œI Make Change,â€</strong> the previously mentioned arcade jam and A-Side to their Ampeater 7-inch, is boldly formless (as is the rest of their hereto-miniscule catalog). After a 20-second intro of warped sound effects, the main riff charges forth like a rhino through a hailstorm. Layered on top are swirls of haunted house ambience and what sounds like a prolonged car accident. Then <strong>Lisauskyâ€™s</strong> drums come in and threaten to shove the thing off the rails. It thrashes and leaps relentlessly, but cohesively, from one idea to the next, completely neglecting to acknowledge anything resembling a chorus or refrain. And then, abruptly, it ends and you realize youâ€™re gasping for air. Had you not read the beginning of the article, youâ€™d be shocked to realize that Tyas is yelping, <em>â€œIâ€™ve slayed monsters and Iâ€™ve sunk threes/Gone gallivanting with a band of thievesâ€</em>â€”perfectly depicting the afternoon of a 13-year-old you with a pocket full of quarters.\r\n\r\nThe B-Side to the single is the perfect counterpoint to <strong>â€œI Make Change.â€</strong> <strong>â€œCrowded Country Roads,â€</strong> the closer and, really, the crown jewel of the <strong>Do Not Play in Reverse EP</strong>, is noticeably less jarring. <strong>Tyas</strong> himself describes <strong>Bong Kongâ€™s</strong> songs as either â€œprettyâ€ or â€œgross,â€ and by contrast, â€œCCRâ€ is practically shimmering. The fundamental groove is a sturdy, bass kick-driven country stomp running alongside a warbly, incessant guitar hook. The trackâ€”driven by <strong>Lisauskyâ€™s</strong> impressive, sputtering kicks and fillsâ€”starts and stops and starts again throughout. At times it thrashes, like weirdo-punk comparables No Age or Bleach-era Nirvana, and then it rests to gear up for another climax. After a funky breakdown about halfway through the track where Tyas whoops and Lisausky fidgetsâ€”a truly danceable moment where Bong Kong maximizes the party vibe it endlessly endorsesâ€”the song smolders to a trail of ash, epically concluding this explosion of an EP.\r\n\r\nWhether the two dudes of which it comprises are willing to admit it or not, <strong>Bong Kong</strong> is a carefully constructed shtick. The songs, the house parties, the stage show, the stickers and artwork (which are a result of Tyasâ€™s job at a publishing company where he, apparently, has free reign over the printing machines) are all part of the epic goofinessâ€”or is it the goofy epicness?â€”that <strong>Tyas</strong> and <strong>Lisausky</strong> are building with Bong Kong. And although original band name candidates Spliffsburgh and Headysburgh come close, there really isnâ€™t a name more apt for Bong Kong than that (despite the references and trippy promotional swag, Bong Kong is actually drug freeâ€”for reasons no one is at liberty to say but are, I can assure you, exceedingly badass). Planned or not, the two insist that itâ€™s all meant to be fun. Like the bit with the hoods and the strobe light: <em>â€œDid we plan it weeks or days in advance? No,â€</em> says Lisausky. <em>â€œIt was, umm, an hour.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<em>â€œItâ€™s just sometimes youâ€™ve got a lot of squares in the room. You gotta light it up,â€</em> interjects <strong>Tyas</strong>. <em>â€œIf weâ€™re gonna get down to the bottom line, weâ€™re trying to get Eric laidâ€¦ Ladies, he is waiting.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<em>\"Iâ€™m clean,\"</em> <strong>Lisausky</strong>.\r\n\r\nAnd that, essentially, is <strong>Bong Kong</strong>. Let them play your house.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Steve Glauber</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Crowded Country Roads [audio:AEM080 Bong Kong/02 Crowded Country Roads.mp3|titles=Crowded Country Roads|artists=Bong Kong]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - I Make Change [audio:AEM080 Bong Kong/01 I Make Change.mp3|titles=I Make Change|artists=Bong Kong]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM080 Bong Kong.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Weâ€™re not talking mass destruction, like if Iron Maidenâ€™s infrastructural backline suddenly started melting down, but a series of smaller catastrophes: the guitar goes out of tune, the homemade electronics begin to shoot sparks and smoke into the audience, the legs of the organ go out like a buffalo shot from a stagecoach. You get the idea pretty much every time you go to a local band showcase in some smaller city in the Northeast, that heart-thunk moment of Oh shit! when the drummer starts soloing mid-verse and the rest of the band exchanges awkward glances, or when the iPod somehow falls out of the chiptune dudeâ€™s back pocket. If music is about controlâ€”tight pants, technology, etc.â€”these are the rough times when entropy turns the mixer all the way to suck.\r\n\r\nBut, as free jazz and Cage and Lucky Dragons and Mix Master Mike all prove, the hard-wired human fear of chaos can go both ways. Sometimes, the Oh shit! moment, in the right hands, can be infinitely more exhilarating than super-tight studio professionalism. You lose control of your internal metronome and embrace the terror of the void.\r\n\r\n<strong>Chad VanGaalen</strong>, who has a name like a Dutch trance producer and the chased-by-wolves voice bizarro of the Meat Puppetâ€™s Curt Kirkwood, has a promo photo of himself sitting alone in what appears to be his backyard, surrounded by odd gadget-y creations, playing a Casio and sticking his finger into a nest of wires. Itâ€™s a scary scene, not only for the rustic hellishness I typically associate with lawns covered in busted-up machines, but also because the whole thing looks like it's seconds away from exploding. I donâ€™t know if Canadaâ€”VanGaalenâ€™s from Calgaryâ€” has looser laws regarding these kinds of hi-tech supplies, but if I wasnâ€™t listening to this guyâ€™s music and loving it, I might be tempted to drop a line to Interpol.\r\n\r\nStill, to paraphrase the Supreme Court, <em>â€œIf it looks like a duck, it must be a duck.â€</em> In <strong>VanGaalen</strong>â€™s case, too, what you see is what you get. If you, like me, get a hard on for homemade rave gear, thatâ€™s a really good thing. Listening to these cuts, B-sides of 2008â€™s <strong>Soft Airplane</strong> (Flemish Eye), you get a sense of how the weird, the out-of-sync and the questionably-conceived can metastasize in genius ways. None of it sounds right. But it all sounds so good.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s sometimes difficult to imagine music being madeâ€”let alone bloggedâ€”these days without a heavy dose of generic calculation. Call it search term tyranny, but I canâ€™t remember the last band that got hyped based on something other than some kind of ostentatious gimmick. This probably has to do with any number of things: the growing unimportance of local scenes, the indie setâ€™s own dictatorial ideas of ironic PR. But werenâ€™t things just a little weirder before the mp3? Not weird in a way that you can categorize, but just subversively, invisibly weird, like Dylanâ€™s Basement Tapes or Sebadoh III, music that sounds off the way a slight case of jaundice might make a person look more unattractive than you remember. Perhaps <strong>VanGaalenâ€™s</strong> found the workaround to this unanticipated side-effect of digital distribution in that pile of circuits in his backyard, but thereâ€™s this cassette era warped-ness in his tunes, an off-kilter malfunction that haunts the music like a ghost in the speaker cabinet. Somewhere between nostalgia and a full-on poltergeist confrontation, this guy has mastered that elusive and alien discomfort that makes old Sub Pop compilations so horrifying and cool. Do you remember Cat Butt, Terry Lee Hale, the Thrown Ups? If you do, you probably know what Iâ€™m talking about. If not, I suggest you do some fucking research!\r\n\r\nA-side (or maybe AB-side) <strong>â€œPyramids Floatâ€</strong> is, despite itâ€™s hallucinogenic title, pretty close to folk music, or at least the kind of folk music that would emerge from a community raised on cow punk rarities collections and whose Bar Mitzvahâ€™s included an obligatory demonstration of synthesizer atmospherics. <strong>VanGaalen</strong> nails that middle ground between rock dynamism and clinical paranoia that makes so many mid-80s indie pop records such awesome listens. With a jerky rhythm like a failing motor and a chorus that wouldnâ€™t seem particularly out of place on a Jawbox record, this song is at once almost scientifically close to a meticulously architected crossover single, and technically sketchy, like an inebriated robot, circuit-bent to perform karaoke on command and nursing the damage with pints after pints of mediocre beer.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œStuffed Animal,â€</strong> on the other hand, comes across as a kind of deranged house music designed to be played exclusively at regional kiddy circuses. Imagine if the eclectic ingredients of drum-machine chatter, Raincoatâ€™s-style pre-K melodic sensibilities, a childrenâ€™s chorus, and <strong>VanGaalenâ€™s</strong> own second-hand auto-detune somehow congealed into an acetate dubplate that you could only play on an orange and blue Fisher Price record player. The batshit appeal here is tremendous. The tune bounces, but sadly, self-reflexively, like a trunk beat for all kinds of universal pre-adolescent baggage.\r\n\r\n<strong>VanGaalen</strong> wards off Armageddon for the duration of these tracks, but just barely. I havenâ€™t seen a car accident for a couple of years, but this is the kind of stuff that makes me want to pay closer attention to the more wrecked parts of the world, the things that donâ€™t fit together, the mistakes that end up becoming bigger parts of who you are than any number of right decisions. VanGaalen starts by breaking a formula. He ends by breaking your heart.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Stuffed Animal [audio:AEM081 Chad VanGaalen/02 Stuffed Animal.mp3|titles=Stuffed Animal|artists=Chad VanGaalen]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Pyramids Float [audio:AEM081 Chad VanGaalen/01 Pyramids Float.mp3|titles=Pyramids Float|artists=Chad VanGaalen]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM081 Chad VanGaalen.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\"><img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"MiniBoone\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MiniBoone-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />There's a part in the Beatles anthology in which Paul talks about the scarcity of resources for young rock musicians in 1950s Liverpool. Without money to purchase records, and without record stores willing to carry rock 'n' roll music, the pre-Fab 4 sat with their ears glued to the radio with the hope that they'd catch a snippet of something hip. Times have changed, the internet's here, and with it is a ridiculous oversaturation of musical content in every style and genre imaginable. Not only is buying music a thing of the past, but getting people to listen to a whole song (let alone an entire album) is becoming increasingly difficult. There are bands and labels out there making unbelievable music that literally can't even give their records away. By now you're probably wondering why I'm opening a perfectly normal review with this dreary state of the union nonsense. Well, because I'm an asshole, and <strong>MiniBoone</strong> almost didn't make it on The Ampeater Review.\r\n\r\nI open every song we receive hoping and expecting it to be the single greatest thing I've ever heard, a magnum opus, the hidden gem of our generation. Really, I do. Besides, it's a small letdown when a submission isn't up to par, and it's a huge thrill when I discover something new and exciting. When <strong>MiniBoone</strong> hit my inbox,Â  I opened <strong>A-side \"Devil In Your Eyes\" </strong>and listened. I listened some more. I listened, and that little voice that makes me do things like start fires and reject bands started warming up. Uh oh. But just as I made a move to trash the whole operation the song began to buildâ€¦and buildâ€¦and then at 1:11, it erupted into one of the most exuberant, spontaneous, and wholly enjoyable choruses I've heard from a rock band in ages, maybe ever.Â  What was I thinking, to have come so close to sending MiniBoone to the nether regions of my recycling bin? Is this what we've come to? I don't want to be responsible for the death of music, and well, I think I came mighty close just there. MiniBoone, I'm sorry, you guys are amazing and as my penance for almost giving you the axe, I'd like to make sure the whole world knows what brilliant music you're making.\r\n\r\nSo let's back it up a bit. It's not that <strong>Miniboone's</strong> <strong>\"Devil In Your Eyes\"</strong> is a lame venture with a redemptive chorus--not at all. That's just how MiniBoone rolls. They come from a world where the Talking Heads reign supreme, and where people have attention spans that last longer than 30 seconds. I think it's the same place Frank Zappa has a summer home, wherever it is. <strong>Craig Barnes </strong>(Guitar, Keyboard Vocals)<strong>, James Keary </strong>(Guitar, Keyboard Vocals)<strong>, Doug Schrashun </strong>(Guitar, Keyboard Vocals), <strong>Sam Rich </strong>(Bass), and <strong>Taylor Gabriels</strong> (Drums) excel at packaging remarkable musical complexities into feverishly catchy pop songs, so much so that it's easy to breeze through their 7-inch without fully appreciating how difficult it is to produce something both quirky and impetuous that doesn't necessarily come across as such. \"Devil In Your Eyes\" should have a little sticker on it that says \"<em>Caution: This song comes spring-loaded.</em>\" Each unison chorus propels the next verse forward with such energy that by 2:23 it's got no place left to go and pulls a Layla, dropping us off into an extended guitar solo and outro that's at least as memorable as the song itself. The now infamous first minute of this song (remember, the one I didn't like?) makes sense now--it's a slow build into that first chorus, after which the elastic snaps and flings us towards the outro at breakneck speeds. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the song needs a slow build, it needs a minute to warm up, like cold pizza, or a space shuttle. Yeah...a space shuttle. Just give it that minute and you'll be damn glad you did.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen <strong>MiniBoone</strong> live (yet), but I imagine the experience would be something like freebasing cocaine while doing windsprints on a rollercoaster. The most exciting music isn't always the most frenetic, and MiniBoone is a case in point. <strong>Side B, \"Cool Kids Cut Out of the Heart Itself\" </strong>is an experiment in highly controlled catastrophe, alternating between sections of total distortion and vocal stopgaps for momentary composure. MiniBoone manages to overwhelm the senses without taking up every last inch of the musical soundscape--there's space to breathe, to ponder the music as it's happening. But not too much. It's a carefully (and perfectly) constructed balance that most bands struggle to find and never quite achieve. Like <strong>\"Devil In Your Eyes,\"</strong> \"Cool Kids\" overheats by 1:04, and takes its time building back up to a grand finale. It might be a formula (it's hard to tell on these 7-inches), but if it is, it's a great one. MiniBoone's music doesn't inspire me to take up painting, it doesn't move me to tears, but it's not trying to. It's doing something very simple, very honest, and very important--inspiring joy. This is music to make sunny days even sunnier, and rainy days not quite so bad. It's light without being frivolous, and serious without succumbing to the disease of douchey pretension that's been sweeping across Brooklyn over the last couple years.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in my parents' house is the record \"Climbing\" by the band Mountain, perhaps best known for the rock radio superjam \"Mississippi Queen.\" On the back is written, <em>\"THIS RECORD WAS MADE TO BE PLAYED LOUD.\"</em> Of course, now I understand that from a technical perspective it's referring to how the record was mastered and cut, but back then I took it at face value. If it was meant to be played loud then what choice did I have? So I cranked the sucker until the walls shook. Well, if it's ever been true, <em>THIS 7-INCH WAS MADE TO BE PLAYED LOUD</em>. There, I said it. Turn up those speakers and let MiniBoone invade your brain. You might even do something crazy, like dance.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Cool Kids Cut Out of the Heart Itself [audio:AEM082 MiniBoone/02 Cool Kids Cut Out of the Heart Itself.mp3|titles=Cool Kids Cut Out of the Heart Itself|artists=MiniBoone]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Devil in Your Eyes [audio:AEM082 MiniBoone/01 Devil in Your Eyes.mp3|titles=Devil in Your Eyes|artists=MiniBoone]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM082 MiniBoone.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

To answer your question, yes, I am lazy. But my hope is that through this experimental meditation on a very special artist, I can demonstrate the very artness of life that surreptitiously surrounds all modes of creative production. Iâ€™ve been the architect of an imaginary universe whose materials are the very stuff of living. Iâ€™m putting my entire life into an aesthetically unified package they call â€˜the recordâ€™. Iâ€™m unpacking my life through my body via sound. (<em>Audience</em>: â€œRightâ€¦â€). In other words, sticking to the tradition of saying the unsayable, this pieceâ€”my return to writingâ€” shouldnâ€™t really be read. [I donâ€™t mean that literally. Keep reading. I also donâ€™t mean the next sentence literally (keep reading)] I plan to masturbate, and cover way too many topics beyond the scope of a blog post. There is a method to my madness, however (melty-brained intentions aside). This exercise is as much about form, construction, confusion, division and sincerity as any of the topics it purports to unpack. My absence from writing will be included within this return to writing as a source of spectral potency. The transitive property of space in ten dimensions: <em>a=b, b=c</em>. Therefore, <em>a=c</em>. Art is Life. Life is Love. Therefore, Art is Love.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lucky Dragons</strong>\r\n\r\nI heard Lucky Dragons for the first time in 2005 when I copped their major-bargain, 47-song CDR compilation-reissue <em>A Sewing Circle</em>. Needless to say, that puppy gave me a lot to digest over many years. When you consider that each Lucky Dragons song is a sound universe in itself (and I really mean it! More than any other artist), the figure of 49 songs begins to feel impossibly large.\r\n\r\nIt helps that the man at the helm, despite having spent his undergraduate years at Harvard and finished a Masters degree in Music from Brown, doesnâ€™t take himself too seriously. When I think about listening to <em>Have One on Me</em>, Joanna Newsomâ€™s new two-hour masterpiece, part of me dies in the face of genius overload. If I didnâ€™t love it so much, I would insist the albumâ€™s grandiosity is its own undoing. <em>A Sewing Circle</em> is like that micro-universe Lisa Simpson (I swear, the jump from Joanna Newsom to Lisa Simpson was not intentional) grew one Halloween: Impossibly huge, but bite-size and pretty cute. Look at these songtitles: â€œI Made You Nervous (In 1995)â€, â€œOne Version of 23-Year Old American Boyâ€, â€œStereo Glitterâ€, â€œOh My Gosh Vaginaâ€, â€œFlake Jingleâ€ and my personal favoriteâ€¦ â€œBluntâ€. Those who know me should be nary surprised that Iâ€™m completely sucked in to this kind of youthful, suburban, fuzzy carpet and VCR and American Flag and weed mythologizing. Itâ€™s just too good to pass up. On the other hand, most of the music that assembles a little shrine to hyper-literate slackerdom is a fucking half-assed generic mess. The thing with Lucky Dragons is, heâ€™s a unique genius and demolishes 98% of the bands in Brooklyn who, to quote the inimitable Charlie Looker, â€œstill canâ€™t figure out how to work their guitar pedals.â€ As if all that werenâ€™t enough to get your ears wet, I discovered during the correspondence leading up to this interview we like, grew up in the same town or something. My hero.\r\n\r\n<strong>Make a Baby</strong>\r\n\r\nThough I had been a semi-enthusiastic admirer (at best) of Luke Fischbeckâ€™s recordings for a few months, it was the first time I saw him perform in 2005 when my interest became devout. Itâ€™s important to understand that Luke Fischbeck is something They refer to as a â€˜total artist.â€™ Meaning, his aims are not constricted to the paths of any particular media. He thinks, he writes, he dances beautifully, heâ€™s a well-regarded visual artist and, of course, heâ€™s a musical genius. So before I try to paint a picture of what a Lucky Dragons show is all about, understand this is not a band. From the bandâ€™s own bio:<em>â€œLucky Dragonsâ€ means any recorded or performed or installed or packaged or shared or suggested or imagined pieces made by Luke Fischbeck, Sarah Rara, and/or any sometimes collaborators who claim the name. The name \"Lucky Dragons\" is borrowed from a Japanese fishing boat caught in the fallout of hydrogen bomb test at bikini atoll in the 1950's. The crew stricken ill, and the boat itself contaminated, the \"lucky dragon\" became a crystalizing symbol for the previously diffuse worldwide anti-nuclear sentiment. Eventually the boat was painted black, renamed the \"dark falcon\", and put into reuse as a fishing vessel, until it was retired and disposed of on the man-made trash island \"dream island\", where it remains today.</em>\r\n\r\nMy vibe is: this kind of band origin myth would be bullshit if it werenâ€™t so sweepingly, tragically sincere. Canâ€™t fault a guy for having deep thoughts about his surrounding environment (Empiricism), not to mention his enveloping interior environment (Metaphysics, Romanticism). Itâ€™s also admirable for outlining a clear socio-aesthetic philosophy. Dig how sensitive Fischbeck is to the sometimes awkward relationship between performer and observer. The circumventing route of course is to create a participant-observer situation for everyone involvedâ€”to bring the spectator into the aesthetic situation like a small society takes on a curious, bewildered ethnographer.\r\n\r\n<em>Lucky Dragons are about the birthing of new and temporary creatures--equal-power situations in which audience members cooperate amongst themselves, building up fragile networks held together by such light things as skin contact, unfamiliar language, temporary logic, the spirit of celebration, and things that work but you don't know why. There have been hundreds of these simple yet shifting and unpredictable instances--with audiences ranging from the intense intimacy of one person to the public spectacle of thousands of people. At the heart of it all is playing together--building up social collectivities, re-engaging the wonder and impossibility of technological presence. It sounds--and looks--like simple and ancient patterns coming together and falling apart in a sincere attempt to let wires and screens and words become clear and crystal. </em>\r\n\r\nLuke Fischbeckâ€™s entire critical dialogue is worth analyzing over and over again. As a total artist interested in spectral and perilous technology, he writes incisively about why music as human production or craft demands to be taken seriously even in a non-Romantic context. The intricate social entanglements of sound technology are a huge part of the history of modern music, particularly music reshaping and responding to the culture of recording. Like another limitless techno-philosopher, Brian Eno, Fischbeck is simply asserting (and rightly so) that Lucky Dragons are about a lot more than just pleasant sound. Much of Fischbeckâ€™s recordings are maddeningly sprawling and schizoid, coming across as curiously indebted to Frank Zappaâ€™s home studio mad science and Madlibâ€™s self-absorbed, weedy beat-shitting. <em>A Sewing Circle</em> even contains this bold yet charming disclaimer: <em>The older the sample is the more itâ€™s getting chopped up and just put in a different context. You might say â€œthat beat sounds like shitâ€ or â€œthatâ€™s a crappy little hook thereâ€ or â€œthat part is nice, I can dance to thatâ€â€” but itâ€™s not about that. I donâ€™t see beautiful or ugly things. Itâ€™s all part of your life and thatâ€™s great.</em> The emphasis on a non-hierarchical approach to aesthetic reflection, along with an apparent interest in play, suggests that Lucky Dragons have given some thought to the thought of John Cage. Well, good. Iâ€™ll be damned if anyone can prove to me after Cage that there is logic to beauty, more specifically to ugliness. Every day is a good day, or so the Zen master says. Why not build up more social collectives focusing on art and music? Why not seek simple and ancient patterns? No one is too busy to sit for a minute and think about how bizarre it is that music even exists, thatâ€™s itâ€™s a documented part of every single human society in existence, and even non-human groups if you want to really get outside of Music Humanities. After all, here we are pulling a thread between music and life. Things work and we donâ€™t know why.\r\n\r\nSo what does all this have to do with the Lucky Dragons performance? Simply, Fischbeckâ€™s performances engage directly with the possibilities and limits of both technology and the self. This is accomplished by the use of an innovative interactive design interface which he refers to as the â€œMake a Babyâ€ Project. Watch the short doc below to get a better idea of the interface components. The fabric itself is uniquely beautiful, fun to crouch over. The rules of the game are fairly straightforward. The tricky part comes in breaking the invisible social barriers that divide bodies in private space. Luckily, Fischbeck is as limber and seductive a performer as the Lucky Dragons moniker suggests. He dances like a worm at a sacrificial ritual. He walks around the room gently asking patrons to grab a rope from the mysterious quilt on the floor. Suddenly, five or six strangers are holding hands, touching each other, giggling. A pixilated rainbow of strong wave tones flutters around the room, morphing but always orbiting around a self-similarly subliminal center. It is here that music is revealed as a living thing. It is the origin myth enacted: curious bodies interacting to produce sound. Iâ€™m not sure exactly what happened that day, but afterwards I felt like there was a little Jake floating out there in the air somewhere. We fucked. We made a baby.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqkqgq867j8\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqkqgq867j8</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/1534996\">http://vimeo.com/1534996</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Life is Long II (Beauty and Philosophy)</strong>\r\n\r\nI want to cast the philosophical lens on the aforementioned â€˜transitive property of space in ten dimensionsâ€™. By â€˜ten dimensionsâ€™ I only mean to emphasize the â€˜worlds-within-worldsâ€™ effect of consciousness/phenomenology. It is the controlling metaphor for understanding art in a universal, rational context: Art as a <em>beautiful</em> way of living; a sublime adventure through all possible dimensions and all possible causal ripples in time; the totality of the thing in itself, from the point of singularity to the â€˜present momentâ€™.\r\n\r\nThe invocation of the word â€œbeautifulâ€ is appropriate here if we are to take Kantâ€™s aesthetic philosophy seriously (we should). In his <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, Kant imagines a tripartite structure of satisfactionâ€”the Pleasant, the Beautiful and the Good. The Pleasant is most similar to what we today call â€œTaste,â€ i.e. itâ€™s limited to individual preference. The Good isnâ€™t quite the Platonic Good in-itself; rather it is bound to utility and economy, the â€œgood forâ€. The Beautiful is the most potent, somewhat like a reference to a universal pulse of satisfaction, free from any concept (for otherwise it would be a utilitarian reflection, or an expression of a personal position, i.e. the Good, the Pleasant). Kant: â€œThe universal voice is, therefore, only an Idea (we do not yet inquire upon what it rests). It may be uncertain whether or not the man, who believes that he is laying down a judgment of taste, is, as a matter of fact, judging in conformity with that Idea; but that he refers his judgment thereto, and, consequently, that it is intended to be a judgment of taste, he announces by the expression â€˜beautyâ€™â€ (15). Itâ€™s a good thing Kant is slightly more reluctant about asserting a metaphysical bedrock of Beauty here than he was about outlining the Categorical Imperative. This demonstrates the powerful contradictions that haunt the very real breach of Life, by Art. Yes, art is a powerful technique of the self, infinite from almost every direction you look at it. Except of course, the perspective from which you canâ€™t see it (Death, the Other).\r\n\r\nMick Taussig once told me, earnestly, that reality is like a block of Swiss cheese: Any way you cut it, you produce a different dimensional landscape with its own unique blend of presence and absence. Itâ€™s a potent image for thinking about the various slices of art in our life, the endless recapitulations of media, each demonstration a metaphor for living in their eruption through space and then figurative or literal disappearanceâ€”time passing, performances ending, people passing and other tricks of consciousness. Consciousness, of course, is the lifeblood of separation. Kantspeak calls this the â€œtranscendental turn.â€\r\n\r\nAccording to Mark Lucht, â€œThe revolutionary idea driving the â€˜transcendental turnâ€™ is that our perceptual and intellectual capacities do not just reflect or conform to the experienced world, but <em>actively contribute</em> to its structure. We project causality onto any conceptualization of events; it is as if, to use one of Kantâ€™s own analogies, human beings all wear space, time, and causality tinted glasses that can never be taken off. Thus Kant thinks that phenomenal nature is known to be saturated with causality simply because human beings are constituted in such a way that they can experience events in no other way but as effects of prior causes.â€ Ostensibly, this is a relatively un-contentious assessment of Kantian phenomenology. Here comes the rub, though. â€œYet since all experience is tied inextricably to the conditions determined by our all too human capacities, we may no longer hope to know anything about things as they are in themselves, independent of any human contributionâ€ (ix). Come to think of it, since Iâ€™m not really interested in the thing in-itself, this blow loses impact. The more troubling issue for me is that we may no longer hope to know anything about the Other, or even non-consciousness. We may make worlds and contribute to the phenomenological cesspool known as the Universe, but weâ€™re also warring specks in a vast cosmos, so whoâ€™s to say how important consciousness really is?\r\n\r\nThe hope is that thereâ€™s no need to pit consciousness against the Heavens. I think Lucht says it beautifully: â€œKant argues that in the aesthetic consciousness, however, there are hints presented to feeling that nature and reason are rooted in the same <em>supersensible substrate; on the level of thing in itself, underneath phenomenal experience and inaccessible to intellect</em>, rational subject and world may originate in a common sourceâ€ (xii, emphasis mine). Iâ€™m sympathetic to this thread in Kantâ€™s project because I think it provides a wonderful conceptual base for thinking about modern music, as well as pushing things forward to realms â€œbeyond music,â€ to what one of my favorite songwriters dubbed â€œfull-spectrum music.â€ Making babies. The life creation inherent in all desire; action; labor; and love.\r\n\r\nAdvancement in music goes way beyond the scope of metaphysics, of course, straight into physics. Much study has been given to the science of music, but it wasnâ€™t until after the Second World War that some truly astonishing empirical works of musical philosophy began to appear. Notable among is the study <em>Sound and Symbol</em> by Victor Zuckerkandl. Itâ€™s a pretty comprehensive philosophical study of music through sound. Many of the examples suffer from gross Euro-centric negligence, such as musicâ€™s elaboration of motion through the so-called â€œParadox of Tonal Motionâ€ (i.e. Non-spatial motion in the realm of tonality). This concept would be neither philosophically elegant for non-Tonal musicians, nor would it be a paradox, since our adjusted views on space (aided by Theory) have allowed for simultaneously metaphorical and empirical dynamism in art. It is that dynamism which must be faced when you fuck a Lucky Dragon.\r\n\r\n<strong>Uncle Luke, Where Do Babies Come From?</strong>\r\n\r\nJacob: How musical is man?\r\n\r\nLuke: <em>\"Musical\" can be as broadly defined as you want it to be... inside of that there's qualifying things you can say: consonant / dissonant, in tune / out of tune, rhythmic / arhythmic, formal / informal, harmonious, melodious, catchy, moving, danceable, legible, virtuosic, etc..but all of these thoughts are contained inside of musical, and are often pretty subjective / cultural / transitory / superficial / slippery. It's been said that the only commonly acceptable way to define \"musical\" would be the quality of sounds as they exist in time--but exceptions to that pop up as you get more abstract... instruments, written or visual scores, lyrics, recordings, could all be musical in and of themselves, just for the mental image of music they suggest, and the ways in which they organize the universe of possible sounds to be made. Also, one could consider music that approaches the limits of conceivable time... especially as relates to music not made by, only appreciated by humans... such as harmonic intervals and relationships in nature.Â  \"Man\"... oh man.... I suppose you could say we are pretty musical by nature, organizing things the way we do... everything very structured, communicative, such a strong need to be understood and to express and to commune in different ways. Whether we are more, or less, musical than other animals, I think the variety of things we call \"music\" would say we are at least the most open-minded about music. The more I think about it, the best way to define either \"musical\" or \"man\" would be as clouds of possibilities, and when the two clouds overlap, and interact, that is completely musical itself! So the answer is: \"completely\".</em>\r\n\r\nJacob: If you are as concerned about the computery aspect of the make a baby project as you seem in the youtube documentary, why is the laptop propped up on a pedestal above the performers, as though creating a shrine to technology? Maybe this speaks to the tension between the technological and the metaphysical in your music, or music in general?\r\n\r\nLuke: <em>Ha! Good question! That documentary is almost 5 years old now, and it's only going to get sillier looking as time goes by... what I was concerned about then was the awkward way the computer worked as a window into the process. It's an organizing intermediary between the sense-world of touch / play / shared control and the sense world of hearing and reacting--as well as an amplifier that strengthens the feedback loop between the two. Transparency was, and is, important to me in the design of the instrument, but figuring out exactly what that meant was difficult. Show the software and provide direct access to it's working? Hide the software and get nearer to closing the loop between hearing and doing? Since the documentary was made, I've figured out how to at least have that translating / reinforcing process set into the background, so that you don't need to keep checking in with it to keep things moving forward in time. Set on the pedestal as it was, it allowed anyone playing the instrument to gauge their own limits of attention, and put into motion changes in texture / responsiveness / tones / etc... it provided some degree of control outside of the physical interface of the conductive material. Accessibility was equated with transparency. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>The auxiliary layer of control is now built into the instrument itself... as the way people, as a group, change their playing, the software reacts to keep things interesting, and reinforce the initial interest in playing with each other. </em><strong><em>Technology provides both a promise of infinity, and an barrier to infinity, like any framing device...</em></strong><em>* Sometimes the way we present the technology is kind of shrine-like, or fetishistic, not in the sense that it is standing in for another object, but in the sense that it is an object standing in for something immaterial (that sense of infinity that encourage play, the bind between self and others, the translation of a gesture into an action, etc). Getting this right, aesthetically, was maybe part of my anxiety. </em>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Jake Brunner</p>\r\n\r\n</div>",

At first it was pretty much as expected: swarms of overzealous photographers, PBR sponsorship, lots of dazed-looking but pretty people, an opening act that was competent but forgettable. Nothing to complain about, but also nothing to really justify all the hullaballoo. I often have this feeling at shows, especially shows where higher-level or hyped bands are playing and something of grand significance is supposedly going on. It's a natural reaction, I think, after reading so much fawning praise of bands, to see them live or hear a song and think â€œthis is it?â€ This tends, for me, to lead to lots of abstract and bloated pondering about whether the world really needs this many god damned rock bands and what the hell we're all doing standing in this room on a Monday night not talking to each other and just sort of waiting for something to happen.\r\n\r\nThen <strong>The Wave Pictures</strong> came on and I forgot all about that. Instantly. It may sounds like I am setting up some sort of self-convincing journalistic hyperbole in which The Wave Pictures are the saviors of modern music. I am not. Modern music is just fine. What The Wave Pictures are is a really fantastic live band made up of three men from London who are talented and instantly likable and who possess an amazing ability to make you smile. They also saved me from my own mind and turned my Monday night into a really lovely evening. When I said in the other Illustrious Internet Publication that I didn't know when the last time was that I saw so many people beaming at an indie rock show, I was telling the truth. Partly, this was due to frontman <strong>David Tattersall's</strong> wonderfully witty lyrics (take the song, for example, in which he starts the chorus with the lines <em>I hate your mother and I hate your father,</em> correcting them on the second go round to <em>okay, I don't really hate your mother, but I really hate your father</em>), which come rapid-fire and display his talent for coaxing serious emotion out of details that are mundane enough to be completely believable. The first song they played at the Knitting Factory had me perplexed at first, with lyrics about two lovers holed up in an apartment doing things like melting chocolate on cookies and writing their names on banana peels, which sounded inconsequential until I heard the line where he discovers â€œhow boring we'd becomeâ€, which revealed to me that the song was actually about how inconsequential those acts are, about the stuffy ennui of a failing relationship.\r\n\r\nThe band is a trio, composed of guitarist/songwriter <strong>Tattersall</strong> (who can rip some unbelievable solos live but tends to refrain on record), bassist <strong>Franic Rozycki</strong> and drummer <strong>Jonny Helm</strong>, and their live and recorded association with songwriters like David-Ivar Herman DÃ¼ne (of Herman DÃ¼ne) and John Darnielle (of The Mountain Goats) makes immediate sense and will help you to place them on the band spectrum. All three acts are notable for complex but direct lyrics delivered over relatively unadorned pop songs (<strong>The Wave Pictures</strong> strike a rock'n'roll/early punk balance that recalls Jonathan Richman), and all three feature singers whose flawed voices suit their songs perfectly: Darnielle's nasality makes his vivid stories more disarming and affecting than a drippy croon would; DÃ¼ne's accented English only enhances his naÃ¯ve sincerity (especially when he sings â€œbaybehâ€) ; and Tattersall's dryly vibrato'd voice fits his Oscar Wilde witty self-destructiveness perfectly.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œJust Like a Drummerâ€</strong>, from the band's Moshi Moshi debut <strong>Instant Coffee Baby</strong>, is a lovely, lazy pop song, the kind in which <strong>The Wave Pictures</strong> specialize, complete with strumming that's muted on the backbeats and charmingly amateurish gang vocals that lend the end of the song an air of hugeness without overwhelming the song (the WPs songs are full of this kind of vocals; they sound like a first take of a bunch of friends clustered half-drunk around a microphone). It's a perfect compliment to the balmy weather we've been having lately, and while the lyrics are surprisingly inscrutable for a Wave Pictures song (they appear to be about living with a writer) they contain some really striking images. The longing in the idea of falling for a woman glimpsed not even on the street but on the street in a film carries a lot of melancholic weight, and the image of the morning sun as a pack of orange spaniels nosing and squirming through the room precisely conveys the irritation of being woken up unwillingly by the sun.Â  Also, the rhythmic cadence of a line like â€œthe whites, the wine and the weedâ€ is immensely pleasurable. The naturalness with which <strong>Tattersall</strong> manages to toss these things off is almost the most impressive part.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œStrawberry Cablesâ€</strong> also manages to be intriguingly oblique, melding what appear to be images of a lonely fat kid eating candy in front of the TV (<em>a lifetime without hips</em> has two potential meanings here) with a chorus that makes the whole thing sound like a song of lost love. The line <em>the world might hate me but it revolves around me now</em> is one of the little revelatory moments that <strong>Tattersall</strong> excels at slipping into his songs, encapsulating the impulse nearly every aimless act of teenage violence. What's most arresting about this song is the melody of the chorus, which is full of both melancholy and determination, underscored by the gentle and marchlike brushwork and bassline. It sounds as if it ought to gently parade along forever.\r\n\r\nBetween songs at the live set, the band expressed their utter relief at finding themselves back in civilization after four days in Florida (this immediately endeared them to me, Florida being the only state in this lovely country I don't much care for). They'd played a rockabilly bar the night before for about five people, and a woman had come up to Tattersall before the show and said, <em>What kind of music do you guys play? Is it country or rockabilly?</em> as if those were the only two types of music that existed. They were thrilled to play and we were thrilled to listen, and that's all you could ask for to banish heavy questions about the meaning of live rock shows. And you're in luck. They're coming to your town soon. You should go give them an audience; they will make your Monday night.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Strawberry Cables [audio:AEM083 The Wave Pictures/02 Strawberry Cables.mp3|titles=Strawberry Cables|artists=The Wave Pictures]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Just Like A Drummer [audio:AEM083 The Wave Pictures/01 Just Like A Drummer.mp3|titles=Just Like A Drummer|artists=The Wave Pictures]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM083 The Wave Pictures.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

This isn't necessarily a bad thing (okay, yes, it usually is a bad thing, but a few of these bands are actually great); it just tends to be how the game works. It makes for some funny contradictions, especially when people argue that the internet hype cycle is somehow more artistically pure than the now-faltering independent label system.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forest Fire</strong>, on the other hand, have inverted the entire hype system with what at first seems like a curiously self-negating approach to being an internet-age band. They don't have a bio or a label (though I'm sure they've had plenty of offers in regards to the latter, and Infinite Best has reissued their highly praised debut album <strong>Survival </strong>on vinyl), and their MySpace url is <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/fuckforestfire\" target=\"_blank\">fuckforestfire</a>. It's puzzling at first for a journalist who is used to parsing through endless band bios jammed full of unwarranted comparisons and mushroom-cloud sized hyperbole in search of some straight biographical info, and it is terrifying that it took me as long as it did to realize that they do this because it gives writers no choice but to <em>pay attention to the music</em>, music being the thing that bands play if you've forgotten, which I pretty much had. And it works because the music is really, really good.\r\n\r\nThe no-bullshit attitude of the band matches their sound perfectly: their songs are tough and simple and not at all flashy. <strong>Mark Thresherâ€™s</strong> vocals echo the slurriness of Marc Bolan, only a little more pissed off and less hung up on sex, and the songwriting shares some qualities with electric T. Rex as well, turning unadorned and deliberate (and often deliciously slow) strumming patterns into memorable rock songs, songs which function not as fixed pieces to be mechanically repeated, but as templates for the band to play with live. It really says something wonderful about a band when every version you can find of a particular song sounds different.Â  For instance, an early live video of <strong>B-side â€œFortune Tellerâ€</strong> (which incidentally starts with one of my new favorite first lines: <em>I only wanna seem good in front of the right people</em>.) adds some eighth-note soul piano, electronic drums, punchy alto sax, and swoopy keyboards. Thresher is also laudably unafraid of letting his voice be heard, especially live, where he sometimes backs off from the mic to let out a full-voiced shout that almost makes him sound like a lost member of The Band.\r\n\r\nBoth of the tracks from this Ampeater single are songs that appear on the band's aforementioned <strong>Survival</strong> LP, but these are live-recorded (and even more stripped down) versions that the band did for a Rough Trade bonus EP. Bands often expose their weaknesses in live and stripped down settings, revealing songwriting that turns out to be pallid without fluttery arrangements, guitar solos that reveal that the album's solo was the best take out of 50 and vocals that would do better buried to the neck in guitars, but <strong>Forest Fire's</strong> songs may even sound better when they're pared down to almost nothing (not that the album's arrangements are particularly florid, but still). Something about these versions of the songs pulses with a badass energy that tops even the performances on Survival.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œI Make Windowsâ€</strong> starts with some simple flute, tambourine and guitars. The chords are a pattern you've heard a thousand times before, but they have that mysterious renewable quality unique to all great rock songs where they somehow don't remind you of any other song, and when the vocals come sliding in with the title phrase, it's just perfect. <strong>Forest Fire</strong> are careful not to put anything unnecessary in their songs, and the twangy electric guitar that fills in a few of the empty spaces leaves just as many alone, because that spaciousness is a crucial part of the song, in the exact way that the line that starts the second verse is followed by about 12 seconds of open space. It takes a lot of maturity to let the songs unfold at their own pace, whatever that pace may be. The additional vocals on the chorus are perfectly understated as well, only leaping out of unison and into harmony occasionally, keeping the song tight and tough where, with the wrong choices, it could have been anthemic in the worst way (imagine the hugest production you can, with like 40 people singing that chorus and an orchestra and lots of booming drums). The guitar solos that follow each chorus walk the fine line between melodic lines and spiney, dissonant bursts, and the fact that they do so in the most exposed setting possible makes them even more impressive.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œFortune Tellerâ€ </strong>starts with that perfectly incisive first line, which, like much of <strong>â€œI Make Windowsâ€</strong> unfolds with a surefooted slowness and let's you know that there'll be no wasting words here. The song then then climbs in tension to the line <em>why not kill someone you hate?</em>, which I'm going to maintain is a pretty bold idea to express in a rock song, especially when your band isn't one that specifically gains cred from being edgy or buries its lyrics in layers of noise. It's a hair out of context here, but to me it sounds like an expression of the frustration of being forced into all sorts of stupid social niceties.Â  The phrase <em>gatling gun social skills</em> touches on a certain violence and coldness that lies underneath all the phony handshaking and schmoozing required of most of us every day. A slightly out of tune toy piano is sprinkled throughout the song, one of the only arranging touches besides the shakers and tambourine that carry the rhythm, lending the whole thing a slightly creepy air that fits with the sharp darkness of the lyrics. In both songs, Forest Fire pull off the other rock n roll mystery trick of making things that are out of tune sound totally legit and not fishy at all.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forest Fire </strong>deserve your ears not because they don't have a band bio or because I find thoughtless internet music writing irritating, but because they write fantastic, subtle songs and perform them without holding back. They are one of a dwindling crop of bands finding listeners almost solely on the basis of their music, and that means a lot at a time like this.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Fortune Teller [audio:AEM084 Forest Fire/02 Fortune Teller.mp3|titles=Fortune Teller|artists=Forest Fire]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - I Make Windows [audio:AEM084 Forest Fire/01 I Make Windows.mp3|titles=I Make Windows|artists=Forest Fire]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM084 Forest Fire.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Life-Size-Maps.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" />\r\nWhen I heard <strong>Life Sized Maps</strong> for the first time my immediate reaction was, <em>â€œWait, haven't I heard this band on the radio?â€</em> Of course, I hadn't, but it sounded like the kind of thing I could have.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, that's a pretty big compliment.Â  It says, <em>â€œyour music has potential to be huge.â€</em> But I'm not sure it's a compliment that the band would be entirely comfortable with because it also implies a critique, <em>â€œyour music sounds like something I've heard before.â€</em> And I suspect it's a comment they get a lot.Â  <strong>Life Size Maps</strong> play a brand of indie pop so chocked full of hooks, some new and some re-contextualized, that they inevitably sound a bit familiar.Â  And yes, they could be huge.\r\n\r\n<strong>Life Sized Maps</strong> is a power trio from NYC featuring <strong>Mike McKeever</strong> on vocals and guitar, <strong>Robert Karpay</strong> on cello, keyboard, and vocals, and <strong>Griffin Kisner </strong>on drums.Â  They formed in 2008 after meeting through music classes at Columbia University and Manhattan School of Music.Â  Though trained in a variety of styles, McKeever explains, <em>â€œwe bonded over the idea that pop music is the most immediate and visceral type of music around.â€</em> It's a philosophy they embrace head on in their music.Â  Life Size Maps bring a surprising blend of youthful energy to the table to compliment their technical ability, churning out a highly infectious brand of indie pop.\r\n\r\nComedian and musician Rob Paravonian likes to rant about <em>Pachelbel's Canon</em>, a composition he's had it out for ever since he was forced to play it in orchestra when he was in middle school.Â  He calls Johann Pachelbel the <em>â€œoriginal one hit wonderâ€</em> and curses about how those eight obnoxious chordsÂ  continue to haunt him to this day, reappearing in just about every popular song of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, from Bob Dylan to Green Day to Aerosmith to Avril Levigne.\r\n\r\nI mention this because in <strong>A-side â€œSeems To Meâ€</strong>, <strong>Life Sized Maps</strong> takes that same (in)famous chord progression and flaunts it.Â  I don't think it's an accident.Â  Maybe those chords found their way into a lot of the hits that Paravonian mentions by chance, but in the case of Life Size Maps it seems like a deliberate re-appropriation of the Canon and all the baggage it carries, that impressive legacy of recycled hits.Â  And because the verse inÂ  â€œSeems To Meâ€ is played on cello (it's the same cello part that scarred poor Paravonian for life) the allusion to the original is pretty unavoidable.Â  So my deja vu upon hearing it for the first time might have something to do with that.\r\n\r\nBut Pachelbel's progression is hardly the only hook in <strong>â€œSeems To Me.â€</strong> The song begins with an energetic dance punk riff while the chorus is more delicate, supported by a cello arpeggio and tight vocal harmonies.Â  The vocal melody is consistently catchy.Â  In the verse it provides brilliant counterpoint to the Canon while in in the chorus, which is harmonically more sparse,Â  it floats to the top.Â  The melody in the bridge is a little more defiant, <em>â€œI shouldn't go to your light anymore...â€</em> But the pinnacle for me is definitely in the final chorus when all of the distinct vocal hooks suddenly dovetail together.Â  It's almost like a round... you know, <em>â€œrow, row, row your boat.â€</em> Its a huge moment.Â  The song ends when the two primary melodies sync up, albeit on different words, <em>â€œseeâ€</em> and <em>â€œdifferently,â€</em> and harmonize.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œMeet Me In The Shadeâ€</strong> has a rather different vibe, but like <strong>â€œSeems To Meâ€</strong> it sounds a bit like something you might have heard on the radio.Â  Or rather, several things you might have heard on the radio.Â  Old ingredients are thrown together to create a new recipe.Â  The recording begins with an atmospheric cello riff that could just as easily be the beginning of a Phillip Glass composition before launching into a peppy pop song (circa 1967) in the style of The Turtles or The Beach Boys.Â  The lyrics have a classic ring to them too, but with a pinch more cynicism. <em>â€œAll Iâ€™m needing is what youâ€™re drinking,â€ </em>McKeever<em> </em>sings,<em> â€œbut I am not prepared, so fill my glass with care.â€ </em> After the second chorus, the vocals drop out for a little while and the melody is echoed on the cello and my favorite moment is at around 2:30 when the entire band drops out except for Karpay, who makes that cello swing harder than I've ever heard a cello swing before.Â  Gradually the drums and guitar creep back in and culminate in an explosive final chorusâ€”well, I'm calling it a chorus but really it's the verse and chorus transposed onto one another.Â  Just like at the end of â€œSeems To Meâ€, <strong>Life Size Maps</strong> again manages to weave several melodies together into a joyous tapestry of pop.\r\n\r\nWhen I listen to <strong>Life Size Maps</strong> I am reminded of a passage in Salman Rushdie's â€œMidnight's Childrenâ€ in which the narrator Saleem Sinai, after spilling his life story for nearly one hundred pages and having not yet arrived at the point where his parents meet , explains that to understand one life you have to swallow the world.Â  Conveniently, I might use a similar excuse for writing a thousand words about Life Size Maps and barely scratching the surface of their music, devoting more time to asides about a 17<sup>th</sup>-century German composer, Rob Paravonian's comedy routine, 1960's pop, and most recently, British-Indian novelist and essayist Rushdie.Â  But I think the same can be true of a band.Â  To understand what Life Size Maps is doing you'll need to swallow Pachelbel's big hit and all the spinoffs it spawned, a legacy of adaptation and parody, you'll need to digest the Beach Boys in their entirety, not just the tasty bits but also the debilitating addiction and depression that sent Brian Wilson into rehab, you'll need to swallow punk, from it's birth in 1970's counterculture to it's marriage with pop in 1990's alt rock, you'll need to...\r\n\r\nGet the idea?Â  <strong>Life Size Maps</strong> is an exhilarating hodgepodge of popular music spanning centuries.Â  Swallow it all.Â  Or if you'd rather, just let it wash over you, listen, and enjoy.Â  Their latest EP is available for free download below.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both;

It was a journey not just of miles, but also of musical maturation. The earlier Loyal Divide received favorable comparisons to Arcade Fire and Wolf Parade, comparisons most bands would be ecstatic about, but the band felt they were destined to make a different style of music. The band pulls no punches in relating their thoughts on their earliest work, <em>â€œFor the first EP, we poured moneyÂ  into recording time at a studio with no real idea of what we were doing. We paid no heed to things like consistency and sequencing, and the whole process was casual. That can work wonderfully for some groups, but it didnâ€™t for us. The music was random and derivative as shit.â€ </em>Thatâ€™s an unusual level of honesty to hear from a band these days (doubtless, they were their own fiercest critics), but Loyal Divide is an unusual collection of guys. In a day and age when most musicians jump from band to band, from sideproject to sideproject, looking for a winner and engaging in the sort of speculation you might expect to see from a Wall Street broker, the five members of Loyal Divide remained true to their project. In the face of the positive notices they received for their first EP, they reapplied themselves to find a sound that was more uniquely their own, in their words, <em>â€œâ€¦.we purchased some rudimentary recording gear and started from scratch. The learning process was long, and the output has been way too slow, but weâ€™ve become more cerebral and particular about our music.â€ </em>Now five years removed from their beginnings in Columbus, Loyal Divide has established itself as a band to watch in its native Chicago and beyond, having carved out a unique blend of breathy shoegaze, Brian Eno intellectronica, and Kraftwerkâ€™d beats. The results of their metamorphoses produced the well-received EP <strong>Labrador</strong>, which the band hopes to roll into a full-length album.\r\n\r\nOn the <strong>Labrador EP</strong> the listener appreciates how far <strong>Loyal Divide</strong> have taken their songs from the indie rock generica of Arcade Fire and Sub Pop flavors-of-the-month. A crunchy looped beat and cocked-pistol sample signals that we are out of the garage and very much â€œin da clubâ€ on the EP opener â€œYoung Bladesâ€. A bubbling wave of synth, a siren blast, and tribal rhythms combine into a DJ Shadow-esque mÃ©lange. The vocals donâ€™t come into full focus until a minute and a half into the four minute song- only then do you realize there is a band behind this wall of atmospheric trip-hoptronica, not a DJ. And when the vocals do come, they are soft, mantric, repetitive, almost sounding like samples themselves, coaxed out of the peaks and valleys of the ambient soundscape instead of being laid over the top like movie credits. <strong>Adam Johnson</strong> and <strong>Christopher Sadek</strong> share the vocal duties; the pairâ€™s strategy is to use vocals to create atmosphere and ambience woven directly into the fabric of the song. There are no American Idol moments here, no Broadway turns, no grandstanding, nothing that will distract the listener from the pulsing musical gestures of the underlying themes. That doesnâ€™t mean the vocals are strictly wallflowers though- in fact, the decisive motif on the song <strong>â€œVision Visionâ€</strong> (named #1 song of 2009 by Radio One Chicago, by the way) is an earthshattering howl. It cuts you to the quick, a sort of Trent Reznor â€œI want to fuck you like an animalâ€ banshee scream that, for all its fearsomeness, kind of makes you want to get out on the dancefloor and shake your damn boo-tay.\r\n\r\nFor their A-side, <strong>Loyal Divide</strong> is sharing with the Ampeater Review readers a single off their upcoming album. The track is called â€œ<strong>DDFâ€</strong> and shows how deftly the group has melded their â€œrock bandyâ€ roots with a more contemporary clubtronica sound. Bassist <strong>Siddharth Chittajallu</strong> and drummer <strong>Andrew McCarthy</strong> lay down a creeping, crawling rhythm over which floats the signature motif of the tracks, what sounds like a sample of classical Hindustani verse run through heavy effects, plus a tremolo. The tremolo transforms the sample into a pulsing, hypnotic wash of sound while the rhythm section continues to grind away at the listener. This motif alternates with forbidding, Depeche-moody vocal stanzas, trading back and forth. And as the song begins to work its way into the interior recesses of your body and mind, a more distinctly Oriental sample fades in like an advancing bank of thick fog, swallowing the listener whole. For the B-side the Ampeater Review is fortunate to get a hold of a previously unreleased mix, a remix of <strong>Loyal Divideâ€™s</strong> popular <strong>â€œVision Vision.â€</strong> All the old elements are in place: the slap bass, dreamy â€œlanding UFOâ€ whir, the hypnotic beats, but a few subtle effects have been added to foreground the fearsome banshee howl all the more. The disco-vampire screech is kicked up a notch, entering a â€œbreakdownâ€-mode for a fiery final salute in the last minute of the song.\r\n\r\nWith a successful EP, a sharp video of their hit single <strong>â€œVision Visionâ€</strong> (shot by BBGun Film) and some good touring/festival experience (the bandâ€™s highlight of SXSW: <em>â€œWe randomly saw GZA on an outdoor stage playing shit from Liquid Swords.Â  So cool.â€</em>), <strong>Loyal Divide </strong>looks poised to make an impact with their as-yet-untitled full-length album set for release sometime in May. The band shared some early insight on the release with the Ampeater Review: <em>â€œIt's basically an expansion of the Labrador EP with 8 or possibly 9 new songs.Â  The new songs sound like NIN on a shoestring budget minus the goth poetry, but a bit looser.â€</em> For all you fans of goth poetry out there, donâ€™t be concerned because there are plenty of dark rites to feast on in the grinding rhythms, synth ambiance, and subbacultcha club aesthetic. Itâ€™s best to leave the industrial haikus to Mr. Reznor, the quasi-reliqious anthems to Arcade Fire, the bedroom indie to Wolf Parade, and let Loyal Divide just be their glorious selves. Itâ€™s worked damn fine so far.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mike Gutierrez</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Vision Vision (Long CC Master) [audio:AEM086 Loyal Divide/02 Vision Vision (Long CC Master).mp3|titles=Vision Vision (Long CC Master)|artists=Loyal Divide]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - DDF [audio:AEM086 Loyal Divide/01 DDF.mp3|titles=DDF|artists=Loyal Divide]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM086 Loyal Divide.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Eleven equally dazzling and classically trained musicians.\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s a consonance in that list of, <em>â€œsounds-like,â€</em> artists mentioned above, though, in that for those artists, their pop sensibilities are front and center of their experimentation (weaker Mars Volta asideâ€¦), prompting my second mental question: <em>â€œI canâ€™t believe these guys arenâ€™t famous yetâ€¦â€</em>\r\n\r\nOne listen to <strong>Emanuel and the Fear</strong> and I suspect you will think the same thing.Â  Hearing them reminded me of the first time I heard Mika, and thought, <em>â€œoh yes, this will catch on in about an hour.â€ </em> And thatâ€™s no sleight either.Â  This impression of imminent success isnâ€™t due, as it might usually be, to pop-culture pandering, lazy-but-fun beats, or any use of auto-tune (thank god).Â  Rather, Emanuel gives this impression because itâ€™s just that good, and just that accessible.\r\n\r\n<strong>Emanuel and the Fear </strong>are the first good band to come out of some place called Brooklyn, New York.Â  Okay, thatâ€™s not true, but letâ€™s not fault them for locational unoriginality.Â  Despite their advanced sound, theyâ€™re relatively new to this game.Â  <strong>Listen </strong>is their first full length, released just last month through <a href=\"http://papergardenrecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paper Garden Records</a>, and already earning them rave reviews from most people with ear holes.Â  This band isnâ€™t afraid to gig, either.Â  How on earth they all fit on stage is beyond me, but theyâ€™re doing just that around Europe as we write/read.\r\n\r\nI challenge you to not like <strong>â€œDear Friend.â€</strong> Go on.Â  Just try.Â  Okay, donâ€™t try too hard, because itâ€™s going to be much more enjoyable to like it.Â  â€œDear Friend,â€ is, at its core, a classic American pop song with a bit of flourish in the form of strings and electronics.Â  What sets it apart is how well executed the flourishes are, and how flawless the pop is done.Â  The track starts with two high energy hits leaving the piano underneath, joined by vocals that give way to the choral build-up of strings and brass.Â  Truly great pop artists are able to milk much satisfaction out of even the smallest moments, and this track is full of them, like the held notes of, <em>â€œand then much to my surpriseâ€¦â€</em> or the trumpet work or trombone solo, or, dear lord, how much do I love the little Muse-esque breakaway in the middle of this track?Â  A lot, thatâ€™s how much.\r\n\r\nAnd somehow this peculiar mid-track-electro-float-to-cloud-9 allows this simple song to return with some snapping, a one note organ riff, and a whole lot more gravity.Â  Already <strong>\"Dear Friend\"</strong> has earned its keep and itâ€™s not even half over, with many majorly epic and sweeping grand pop moments to come.Â  The rest is a pretty textbook intro to choral swells and post-verse builds that, with additions of backing vocals and some real live strings (Thank god!Â  I love you, keyboards, but you werenâ€™t built to simulate strings) that retain full tone and therefore keep the power of the harmonies.Â  <em>Do do do do do do doooo</em>â€¦<em>something I never thought Iâ€™d say</em>.Â  And then, of course, closing on the same two hits, like a gymnast nailing the landing.\r\n\r\nWatching <strong>B-side â€œGuatemala,â€</strong> played <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzK3NQbL9HU\">live</a> really cements a subtle Rage Against the Machine element to the repertoire.Â  Partially because of the Morello-esque riffing, partially because of the political fire <strong>Ayvas</strong> spits here, and probably mostly because of the Zach de la Rocha hairdo.Â  Though this is one of the few times on <strong>Listen</strong> that the energy and vitriol reaches this level, <strong>Emanuel and the Fear</strong> pull it off quite effortlessly, and with some very diverse flourishes.Â  Once again the string and woodwind section complement the meaty pop extremely well, and some particularly punchy electronic drum hits are blended in expertly to give a nice electronic cusp to an otherwise fully symphonic powerhouse song.\r\n\r\nI like this track as a B-side because I think it really shows off <strong>Emanuel and the Fearâ€™s</strong> range, both sonically in the many genres of music weaved into the work, and also emotionally, particularly in contrast to the jaunty <strong>â€œDear Friend.â€</strong> <strong>\"Guatemala\" </strong>hasÂ got a hell of a bite to it, and The Fear create a lot of that tension by playing off the standard rock and roll drum-bass-guitar<strong>. </strong>From the chaotic flute barely perceptible at the beginning of the track, to the swelling strings trading off moments with the vocals.\r\n\r\nThe album definitely takes quite a lot of emotional and tonal turns.Â  Less well executed, and <strong>Emanuel and the Fear </strong>might be labeled, â€œchaoticâ€¦disorganizedâ€¦blah blah blah.â€Â <strong> </strong>Ultimately, youâ€™re not really going to hear those things because Emanuel and the Fear succeed.Â  They succeed because their music is earnestâ€”uncomplicated in its complexity.Â  People tend to worry more about disorganization when the music isnâ€™t good and theyâ€™re grasping for reasons why (read: Iâ€™m suspicious of this as a reason for a musicâ€™s failure).Â  Fortunately, the great thing about music as an immersive art form is that we can forget about all that for a while, the critical us.Â  So when youâ€™re done reading this increasingly ironic appraisal, my final recommendation is to enjoy the hell out of these songs.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Rick Andrews</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right;

The opportunity came our way thanks to Portland Maine's <a href=\"www.eternalotterrecords.com\" target=\"_blank\">Eternal Otter Records</a> and its <a href=\"http://theottersden.wikispaces.com/Vinyl+Single+Series\" target=\"_blank\">\"Death, Rebirth, and Transformation\"</a> 7-inch series. If most of the music that hits your ears was made somewhere along the L train, now's the time to perk up and pay attention, because there's something special happening up north.\r\n\r\nSometimes the harrowing tale of a tiny label's mission to bring great music to the masses is as compelling as the stories of the artists themselves, and so we come upon Eternal Otter Records, one of the best adjective-animal name combinations in recent memory, and the proud parent of three vinyl 7-inches showcasing Portland Maine's finest talents. Eternal Otter Records came to be as the result of Will Ethridge's endeavors to showcase local talent in his downtown apartment. The venue, referred to as the \"Tower of Song,\" became a Portland institution, and Ethridge immediately saw the importance of what was transpiring there. He founded Eternal Otter Records with a spirit of benevolence and pride, acutely aware of the duty implicitly bestowed upon him to spread the music that he was fortunate enough to have witnessed.\r\n\r\nSo many small musical communities are only recognized after the fact. We're guilty of this \"nuggets\" mentality that encourages us to fetishize obscurity for its own sake, and to eulogize bands of little fame (and sometimes merit) purely because they're the last remaining albatross in an otherwise meticulously scrutinized chapter of musical history. 1960s LA garage bands were simply. not. that. great. Get over it. Get over it and prevent some incredible artists from becoming \"nuggets.\" Help them become an important part of the musical timeline, and not just something to be dug up on \"lost classics\" college radio. I think Will Ethridge understands this plea, and I think it's with this in mind that he's gone out on a limb and produced the \"Death, Rebirth &amp; Transformation\" series.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cerberus Shoal</strong> has been around in various incarnations since 1994. In the last decade and a half the band's taken on more shapes and sounds than is reasonably possible to describe in writing. Ethridge describes them as a \"prolific avant-rock collective\" and that's the best capsule description I've heard to date. This 7-inch, featuring <strong>\"Tailor of Graves\" </strong>and <strong>\"Hymn\" </strong>(as A and B side respectively) is a perfect introduction to the band's eclecticism, ranging in influence from Crosby Stills &amp; Nash to Guillaume de Machaut. Both tracks are drawn from an 8-song suite called <strong>The Ongoing Ding</strong> that was recorded in 2003 but never saw release. It was originally conceived as an extension to \"The Ding,\" an 18 minute odyssey that closed the group's split EP with Alan Bishop. Fans of avant-pop take note--this 7-inch is for you.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Tailor of Graves\"</strong> begins with a bang. Well, it's more like a pop, as though someone were literally uncorking the song. It opens with an off-kilter banjo loop before diving into a group harmony that uncannily resembles the outtakes for David Crosby's \"If I Could Only Remember My Name,\" albeit with more moments of overt dissonance and tension. I've been wooed lately by the notion of the highly-sophisticated-art-music-collective (remember <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem021\" target=\"_blank\">Cuddle Magic</a>?). Sure, there's a power to three-chord rock bands that arguably transcends the simplicity of their chosen form, but it's sometimes hard to top the overpowering intellectualism of groups like <strong>Cerberus Shoal</strong>. The collective consciousness overrides any one ego, and results in pop constructions that are so thoroughly vetted as to be almost inscrutable. \"Tailor of Graves\" sets course on such a comfortable trajectory that it's a genuine surprise when the song twice builds to extraordinary tension, only to slip effortlessly back into familiar territory. This careful balance between experimental and folk influences make Cerberus Shoal both immediately likable and pervasively unsettling. Both lines run concurrently through \"Tailor of Graves,\" earning it a spot as a perennial favorite on my turntable these past couple weeks.\r\n\r\nIts flip side, <strong>\"Hymn,\"</strong> falls heavily on <strong>Cerberus Shoal's</strong> experimental side. \"Hymn\" is just that--well, kinda. Borrowing elements from medieval and renaissance music, both sacred and secular, it's a strange hybrid between genuine homage and modern interpretation. I'm not entirely sure that it does justice to one or the other. Maybe both. This is the kind of music that I studied enough as a student that I'm able to appreciate it when I hear it while never once seeking it out of my own volition. And yet, there's a crop of brilliant musicians that find it deeply moving--Dave Longstreth (The Dirty Projectors) drew heavily upon it for The Getty Address, and Charlie Looker (Extra Life) very clearly styles his vocals according to medieval musical principles. It would seem that the joke's on me, and that Cerberus Shoal has tapped into a prominent vein of influence for a certain school of modern musicians. The piece opens with a duet on melodica(?) that continues in a supportive capacity throughout, as percussion and vocals are layered above it. The only obvious hints that we're hearing something distinctly modern are the ticking clock and bubbling electronics that emerge as the song winds to a close. I'm still not sure whether \"Hymn\" is so called because it is, or isn't, supposed to be listened to as such. Is it a play on the form, or a specimen of the form itself? And what the hell happens after \"Tailor of Graves\" (Part 2 of \"The Ongoing Ding\") that we arrive at \"Hymn\" (Part 8 of the same)? We may, in fact, never know. Cerberus Shoal disbanded in 2005, and while its members are still playing in various formats (most in a band called Fire on Fire), it's doubtful that there'll be any real push to see a complete release of <strong>The Ongoing Ding</strong>. That is, unless Eternal Otter steps up to the plateâ€¦so how about it Will?\r\n\r\nThis 7-inch is available on vinyl now through the <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/store/vinyl/tailor-of-graves-hymn-7-inch\" target=\"_blank\">Ampeater Store</a>.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Hymn [audio:AEM088 Cerberus Shoal/02 Hymn.mp3|titles=Hymn|artists=Cerberus Shoal]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Tailor of Graves [audio:AEM088 Cerberus Shoal/01 Tailor of Graves.mp3|titles=Tailor of Graves|artists=Cerberus Shoal]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM088 Cerberus Shoal.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

For some more background info, I'd recommend checking out the <a href=\"http://www.ampeatermusic.com/aem070\">first one</a>.\r\n\r\nBoth the songs on <strong>Will Stratton's</strong> second Ampeater single deal with the confusions of love lost and found. It's pretty traditional ground for pop songs, but unlike most pop music, which revels in the heat of the moment, in emotions flattened and compressed into universal banalities, these songs are deeply personal and contemplative. Rather than wallow in the first overheated flush of love or self-pitying pall of loss, they look backward with a subtler, more mature brand of anger or desire.\r\n\r\nAnchored by <strong>Stratton's</strong> breathy vocals and intelligent lyrics (whether they're hovering in a sea of dreamy electric guitars as on <strong>A-side â€œLying in the Darkâ€</strong> or riding a wave of fierce fingerpicking, as on <strong>B-side</strong> <strong>â€œDo You Remember the Morningâ€</strong>), they don't pretend to resolve into easy, clear emotions but instead draw out the contradictory feelings that are always a part of love affairs, whether or not we like to admit it to ourselves at the time.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>â€œLying in the Darkâ€</strong>, a song that revolves wholly around the untrustworthiness of truth, <strong>Stratton's</strong> narrator seems torn between flinging hurtful words at an ex-lover who has clearly hurt him and revealing the honest but now tainted.Â  At different points in the song, he tells her <em>why didn't I just tell you/ you're pretty but I never felt a thing / 'cause that would be a lie</em> and then follows this confession with <em>and every night I'd pray/for something interesting to say/but you never even caused a single spark. </em>Which of those statements is true? Both, perhaps. It's complicated and full of uncertainty and unresolved emotions, just like actual relationships. This willingness to explore what is ambiguous and shifting is one of the things I admire most about Stratton's songs, as the way we experience the world doesn't digest so easily as the radio would have you believe.\r\n\r\nNearly the entire song is underscored with hazy electric guitar picking and light, simple drumwork, which forms a soothingly repetitive backdrop for the lyrics, but instead of just allowing this delicate frame to carry the song gently into and out of your ears, <strong>Stratton</strong> uses it to set up a moment of supreme yet subtle drama in which, after the second verse, literally everything drops out except for one electric guitar. This guitar plays a fiery solo that pushes and pulls the time and meter, adding and dropping beats and notes in a way that conveys the depth of the emotion at hand, the shaky ground described. It sounds almost as if it is brimming over with anger, a violence that Stratton's voice never touches, and when the rest of the instruments return, exactly the same way they left, it leaves you with the feeling of having just watched someone who is usually extremely composed burst out shouting in the middle of an argument and then just as quickly return to normalcy. The light drums and airy guitars sound the same but they are not the same.\r\n\r\nThis single also carries on the motif I mentioned in the previous review of stretching <strong>Stratton's</strong> previous records' pretty, fingerpicked folk songs, expanding the forms and techniques enough to make them slightly more elusive and thus even more rewarding upon repeated listens. This experimentation with form stems from Stratton's interest in capital-c Composition (you will recall from the last review his familiarity with all sorts of modern classical composers I hadn't heard of, and I will add here that he studied the subject at Bennington College), something that started all the way back in his high school days:\r\n\r\n<em>Ever since I fancifully started considering myself a composer of serious music when I was in high school, I have led a dual musical existence, where on a good week I would write (meaning make up and remember through repetition) a little ABAB-form song about love or loneliness or fate or whatever,Â and the next dayÂ I would write (meaning actually write down) a spiky, meandering, Gnossienne-ish miniature for piano. Things approached a more absurd disconnect when I was working on my second record, because I was recording songs that were more polished and preening than anything I had ever attempted before, and at the same time I was composing some pretty strange music heavily inspired by people like George Crumb and Earle Brown, music full of heavy silences and seagull glissandos and indeterminate notation.</em>\r\n\r\nThe songs here haven't ventured into Crumb territory yet, but they take the ABAB pop song format and remove the rigidity of tempo and exaggerated differences between verses and chorus.Â  Instead of marking each section as clearly as possible, they flow naturally and organically from section to section, and only by stopping and thinking about it can one see the seams. <strong>â€œDo You Remember the Morningâ€ </strong>begins with the title phrase, built up in fragments of increasing length from <em>do you</em> to <em>do you remember the morning, </em>all of it hanging over some low, rubato guitar chords. Stratton really likes to play with rhythmic accents as well as meter, and you can hear that here in the way he emphasizes the upbeat of the first note of each bar, around 1:25. These strange emphases take a song built on just acoustic guitar and vocals, like so many others, and turn it into something that maintains a sense of mystery and intactness, aided by immense skill of Stratton's guitar playing. The whirling solo brings out some of the same intensity of emotion here, again serving as the emotional apex of the song, yet here the energy is more positive, desire rather than recrimination (okay, maybe a little bit of both. After all, love is complicated).\r\n\r\nTalking about <a href=\"http://www.ampeatermusic.com/aem084\">Forest Fire</a> last week, I mentioned how exciting it is (not to mention how much it speaks of the viability and importance of the musician in an age of endlessly reproducible digital recordings) to hear a band who take advantage of the opportunity, as human beings with instruments and imaginations, to play their songs differently each time. Stratton is a perfect example of someone who falls into that category, as evidenced by his recent <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/spinning/episodes/2010/03/14\">WNYC Spinning On Air</a> performance, which includes alternate versions of each of the songs on this single (<strong>â€œLying in the Darkâ€ </strong>winds up in a whole different time signature and <strong>â€œDo You Remember the Morningâ€ </strong>is slightly accelerated and a bit more frenetic). As I said in the first piece, maturity and musicianship aren't exactly the things that set the blogs a buzzing, at least not as much as they ought to, but when it comes to making music that has staying power and significance beyond what the latest hyphenated genre trend happens to be, Will Stratton is a pretty great person to be right now.\r\n<p style=\"float:right\">Gabe Birnbaum</a>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Do You Remember the Morning [audio:AEM089 Will Stratton/02 Do You Remember the Morning.mp3|titles=Do You Remember the Morning|artists=Will Stratton]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Lying in the Dark [audio:AEM089 Will Stratton/01 Lying in the Dark.mp3|titles=Lying in the Dark|artists=Will Stratton]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM089 Will Stratton.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Three original members departed for good, eventually replaced by <strong>Dan Bills</strong> (synths/keys), <strong>Evan Duby</strong> (lead guitar) and <strong>Brian Ver Straten</strong> (drums). <strong>Mike McCabe</strong> (bass) took a sabbatical around 2008 and, in the words of the remaining musician <strong>Brian Sendrowitz</strong> (vocals/guitar/casio), <em>â€œâ€¦I found myself suddenly without a band- I spent the next year working on</em><em> Safe Inside the Sound</em><em> mostly on my own.â€</em> The band, or â€˜collectiveâ€™ as Brian has taken to calling Beat Radio, had been whittled down to one (a â€˜collectiveâ€™ of one!). It takes no small amount of guts to hold onto your dreams in the face of loss and adversity, but struggle has always produced great art. Like a fire that rekindles from a single ember, so it was with Beat Radio. <em>â€œI started collaborating with Dan Bills about halfway through [Safe Inside the Sound], and he ended up playing on the album and bringing a lot to it on keys and synths. When the album was finished this past fall we started playing out regularly again and the band grew slowly and organically.â€</em> By the end of 2009 Beat Radio was stronger than ever. <em>â€œWeâ€™ve been playing as a 5-piece since December and itâ€™s definitely the most fun and rewarding experience Iâ€™ve had playing in a band.â€</em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"pressphoto aligncenter\" title=\"Beat Radio\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Beat-Radio.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" /><em style=\"font-size:8pt\">Credit: Gilbert Ng</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Nothing pulls a band together faster than good material. <strong>Safe Inside the Sound</strong> boasts an albumâ€™s worth of solid songs that run the pop gamut between alt-Americana and indietronica. The winsome melodies, dressed up in synth progressions and digibeats, will tempt the melancholy onto the dancefloor half the time (and have them weeping into their beer the other half). There is a Great Plains sadness here, a â€œseen them come, seen them goâ€ folky sadness that points to the earlier songwriting of <strong>Sendrowitz</strong>: <em>â€œBefore Beat Radio, Iâ€™d done more acoustic based singer songwriter music.â€</em> With Safe Inside the Sound the compositions hewed away from freeform folk paeans, towards more tightly regimented pop structures. <em>â€œThe biggest change was writing songs to rhythm tracks.Â  Before that, lots of my songs had a strummy, looser sort of feel â€“ like Van Morrisonâ€™s Astral Weeks.Â  With Beat Radio songs, Iâ€™ve set out to make songs that were simpler, more like pop music, and hopefully more universal.â€</em> There is an inherent optimism in pop music that counters the more tragic tones of <strong>Beat Radio</strong>, resulting in a delicate dialectic between sadness and joy that speaks to the heart.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Safe Inside the Sound</strong> sells the indietronica hard for the first three tracks of the album. Opener â€œFollow You Aroundâ€ is particularly impressive. A chorus of quasi-industrial synth sounds paints a picture of quiet emotional devastation- the perfect backdrop for <strong>Sendrowitzâ€™s</strong> heartbroken vocals- before exploding into a thunderous blitzkrieg of teeny-bopper transcendence and pitch-shifty solos. After t initial electronic flourish, <strong>Beat Radio</strong> starts to gradually foreground the guitar over and above the synths. â€œStranger Flowersâ€ is straightforward, strummed folkrock melancholia, albeit with digital beats. â€œGreen Luxury Condoâ€ drops the beat altogether in a reflective paean to the melody of â€œAmazing Grace.â€ Itâ€™s around this point in the album that you realize Beat Radioâ€™s influences are less MGMT, more the folk and country greats of yore. So when you hear â€œHard Times for Dreamersâ€ towards the end, with its moseying guitar, dusky lyrics, and mandolin, youâ€™re hardly taken by surprise. Most every track on Safe Inside the Sound could become your new favorite song. The real acid test of the album though is the singing of Brian Sendrowitz. He worships at the altar of some other polarizing vocalists: J Mascis, Neil Young, Daniel Johnston. Either you <em>get</em> his style, or you donâ€™t, and that will make all the difference.</p>\r\nThe Ampeater Review finds <strong>Beat Radio</strong> at a particularly significant juncture in its development. The digital 7â€ includes of some of the first post <strong>Safe Inside the Sound</strong> material to be released, although tracing timelines with a collective can be deceiving. The B-side, <strong>â€œLonely From Rock and Roll,â€</strong> was actually co-written in 2003 by <strong>Sendrowitz</strong> and Timothy Lannen, who, along with Robert Haussmann, were both charter members of the very first incarnation of Beat Radio (both continue to play music as the Diggs). The title comes from a humorous lyric by the Tragically Hip, but the underlying motication is more melancholy. As Sendrowitz recalls, <em>â€œIt was towards the end of that band we were in, and believe it or not, it was kind of about the band breaking up. I always really liked the song, but it always felt unfinished.Â  As a writer, I donâ€™t ever really throw anything away.Â  Songs are like your kids, you want to see them through, see them get recorded, performed, etc.Â  I actually finished writing the song in early 2008 and recorded a demo.Â  It was weird â€“ the Beat Radio lineup from that time was sort of winding down, running its course, slowly breaking up.Â  Maybe it was something about those emotions that reminded me of â€™03, and let me finish the song at that time. Working on the track over the last few weeks definitely brought me back to both of those times â€“ kind of bittersweet memories.Â  Do you know that Mercury Rev song 'Holes'?Â  Thereâ€™s that great line: 'Bands, those funny little plans, that never work quite right.'â€ </em>\r\n\r\nThe A-side, <strong>â€œHigh Timeâ€</strong> is the inspirational yin to the melancholy yang of <strong>â€œLonely From Rock and Roll.â€</strong> <strong>Sendrowitz</strong> describes his writing process for the single: <em>â€œâ€¦I like the idea of trying to write a really simple song that can be useful to people and maybe inspire them in a direct sort of way.Â  So many songs we hear these days are cloaked in multiple levels of irony.Â  When youâ€™re trying to write something that is universal, you sort of have to let go of the fear of being clichÃ©.Â  My wife Liz inspired this song pretty directlyâ€“ thereâ€™s a line in it that says 'thereâ€™s nothing for you going upstream.' Â Thatâ€™s something weâ€™ve been trying to practice.Â  You have to be open to let life happenâ€“ when youâ€™re struggling really hard, swimming against the tide, you may be going in the wrong direction.â€</em> The narrator ruminates on â€œfacing your fateâ€, a terrifying prospect for all of us. But the redemptive power of love and beauty means that none of us have to face that fate alone.\r\n\r\nSince <strong>Safe Inside the Sound</strong> <strong>Beat Radio</strong> has tweaked their record release strategy in a move that is partly pragmatic and partly reflective of their personality. The bandâ€™s goal for 2010 is to finish and release two songs every month, thereby skirting the album format. <em>â€œMost of [the songs] will come out via our Bandcamp page...[the Ampeater digital 7â€ is] an exception, because this Ampeater piece is a special occasion!â€ </em>In the new digital landscape where an album can circulate around the internet in less than a dayâ€™s worth of pop-and-fizzle, releasing tracks a couple at a time allows a relationship to form between artist and audience. <em>â€œI donâ€™t know if singles will become dominant over albums, but as an artist, it has been kind of refreshingâ€¦Having something to share with people on a consistent and regular basis makes sense, and is really rewarding, because weâ€™re in direct contact with our audience.â€ </em>Thatâ€™s a welcome approach to new media in a time when most bands use social networks as one-way megaphones to PR-indoctrinate their fanbase.

Like a case of asymptomatic herpes, Frenchness has a tendency to lurk in records, unregistered, unapparent, somehow spreading its genotype throughout the host until itâ€™s too late to do anything about it. Other kinds of categorically foreign rock donâ€™t have this invisibility problem: NME buzz bands swear by the Digidesign Cockney Box (now a preset in ProTools 8), Japanese groups trade compulsively in Orientalist kitsch, and Scandinavian singers canâ€™t help but sound awkward as balls. But how are we to know weâ€™ve been Frenchâ€™ed? The answer here isnâ€™t that much different than the methodology used by Baseball cynics to identify steroid abuse: the players are too good not to be doped. French musicians, similarly, are too good not to be French. <strong>Lozninger</strong>, a French producer/songwriter whose style lands somewhere between Serge Gainsbourg, the Silver Apples, and Karlheinz Stockhausen, is very, very good.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s crucial here not to equate the French propensity for crafting immaculate pop songs with a racist a priori like black people are good rappers, or even something logical, yet reductive, like Indonesians make the nicest gamelans. Itâ€™s not enough, in other words, to write these things off as natural. Instead, we need to work backwards from the who to the why. <strong>Lozninger </strong>himself sets us in the right direction with this priceless quote about his artistic output: <em>â€œLÃ˜ZNINGER's music extremely sucks though some people say it sounds nice.â€</em> The closer you look at this statement, the more you realize how transcendentally apt it is in describing that elusive, quasi-nonexistent French aesthetic weâ€™ve been groping for. I donâ€™t want to be dismissiveâ€”and believe me, Iâ€™m MySpace buddies with more than one French bandâ€”but how often when a group is categorized as French Pop is that an indicator that the music theyâ€™re making is, in at least one or two obvious ways, really terrible? Letâ€™s look at some outdated, but trendy, examples: Justiceâ€™s music, with its obese mid-range blastsynths, its pseudo-glitchy malfunctions, its winking homages to hair metal, is essentially a counterintuitively awesome culmination of horrible influences and creative choices. Air and Daft Punk, too, seem to occupy a similar state of qualitative ambiguity: Barry Manilow in a space suit is objectively still Barry Manilow. In a space suit. Undoubtedly bad ideas, in all these cases, miraculously add up not necessarily to more than their constituent parts, but something so effortlessly cool, so autistically controlled, that their constituent parts cease to exist. Can you think of any American band where influence is subverted in such a holistic way? Imagine something as innocuously unbearable as Smashmouth, ostensibly a revamp of 50â€™s doo-wop music with a big-room house twist, and you get the idea of how strange and impossible to duplicate the French model of sonic success really is.\r\n\r\nTo get a sense of how <strong>Lozninger</strong> figures into this context, it might be best to take a look at the <strong>B-side</strong>, a cover of Britney Spears's <strong>â€œToxic.â€</strong> Ironic indie-rock covers of multiplatinum mega-hits is a practically antediluvian practice at this point, so overplayed that you might expect to find one buried near the cave paintings at Lascaux packaged along with a promotional coupon for a pair of Reeboks. Goddammit, this shit is so terrible most of the time! But Lozninger, with a practicedâ€”or, I suppose, ancestralâ€”nonchalance towards this kind of thing (<strong>â€œEw, that song by Brittneey Speeaars,â€</strong> I imagine some dude wearing APC jeans and aviator shades, pulling on a Gauloise and downing a 5 Euro bottle of fantastic wine, saying completely unselfconsciously, <strong>â€œEet is tres cool, no?â€</strong>) manages to make the tune, already perfect in its original incarnation, not only worthwhile but worth your time to check out. By dropping the <em>Night on Bald Mountain</em> string hook that 100% made the Britney jam and replacing it with acoustic guitars, hushed vocals, some suffocatingly-dense atmospheric synths, the effect of the cover is less one of laffs than of a guilty pleasure, like the urge to eat not one but two orders of mozzarella sticks, slowly grafting itself to your insides. What can I say about this version other than it seems sincere, so sincere that it makes you appreciate the song platonically rather than discretely, a masterpiece of celestial tunesmithing in search of the ideal vessel. Of course, if Dynamite Hack decides to come out of retirement, this no longer applies.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lozningerâ€™s</strong> more, I donâ€™t know, artistic side, comes out in <strong>â€œMoving Targets,â€ </strong>a beautifully constructed bit of noise-pop, all found sound and melancholic piano that seems to fall into playlist format almost by accident. Originally when I downloaded these tracks, only the first twenty seconds of this song came through, and I was forced, temporarily, to contemplate what it might mean to package â€œToxicâ€ alongside the inchoate blips and fuzz of the A-sideâ€™s opening bars. I guess itâ€™s kind of like a 4-minute <em>Pet Sounds</em>. Which, come to think of it, is about as French a maneuver as going on vacation on a Wednesday, or eating pizza with a fork.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Toxic (Britney Spears cover) [audio:AEM091 Lozninger/02 Toxic (Britney Spears cover).mp3|titles=Toxic (Britney Spears cover)|artists=Lozninger]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Moving Targets [audio:AEM091 Lozninger/01 Moving Targets.mp3|titles=Moving Targets|artists=Lozninger]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM091 Lozninger.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Â  As a child, he would often go down to his family's acreage outside of Birmingham, Alabama, where he was introduced to music by his grandfather who would sing for him in that same thick southern accent.\r\n\r\nWhen you're a baby, you don't know how to categorize.Â  You see an apple and it's an apple.Â  You see an banana and it's a banana.Â  You see a carrot and it's a carrot.Â  As you grow up you learn that the apple and banana are fruits while the carrot is a vegetable.Â  Similarly you learn that the bowing of a violin and the beating of a drum are music while the revving of a motorcycle engine and the rustling of the wind through the trees are notâ€”at least until you study <em>musique concr</em><em>Ã¨</em><em>te</em> in college and unlearn it all.Â  But I think that even as an adult, we're prone to a sort of biased essentialism, through which our definition of the category is skewed by our experience with the specific.Â  When I think <em>city</em>, I think New York City.Â  When I think <em>cat</em>, I think tabby cat, because my family kept one as a pet when I was young.Â  And I suspect that when Bateman thinks <em>music</em>, he thinks of the music his grandfather used to sing for him as a child in Birmingham.Â  And so, while Uncles is plays a lot more than just folk, it's clear that folk is at the core of the music that they create.\r\n\r\n<strong>Bateman</strong> and <strong>Schwartz </strong>have been playing together since middle school.Â  Bateman would return from his childhood trips to Alabama and work with Schwartz to develop the songs he had written there.Â  By early high-school they had begun seeking out band members among the regulars at open-mic clubs, and they played their first show together at the tender age of 16 in Yonkers.Â  After positive reviews from coworkers, they soon took their act to New York City, where they both eventually attended college.Â  As time went on they broadened their musical horizons and began to drew inspiration from more varied sources.Â  In particular, they cite the influence of classic 90's indie rock outfits such as Pavement, Guided By Voices, and The Pixies, and C&amp;W singers like Hank Williams, George Jones, and Townes Van Zandt<strong>.</strong> By adulthood, each had developed an eclectic musical and compositional voice and together they gained recognition performing at New York City's folk and indie-rock dives, as well as at nearby Wesleyan, Bard, and Vassar colleges.Â  In addition to Bateman and Schwartz, <strong>Uncles</strong> utilizes a rotating ensemble to back their songs which includes a double bassist, violin, pianists, and drummers.Â  Their performance is musically diverse, with different members of the 'Uncles Ensemble' bringing their training from free jazz, classical, and folk idioms to support the songs.\r\n\r\nBut vocals are the central feature of <strong>Bateman</strong> and <strong>Schwartz's</strong> songwriting, thanks to their surprisingÂ  delivery (Bateman's rough country drawl) and their their content, which spans all topics, from the most mundane to the profound.Â  â€œ<em>There's a lot of sex,</em>â€ theyÂ  explain, â€œ<em>some urban grit, a fair share of plaintive mid-western balladeering, tales of nursing-home dementia, and plenty of violence, too.</em>â€Â  Basically, there's something for everyone.Â  Only when you listen to the lyrics does it really hit you that this band is not from Alabama but from the Big Apple's extensive sprawl. I would never have made the comparison after only hearing their music but after seeing the lyrics on paper, I instantly thought Tom Waits. The sex and urban grit are expressed in a piercing but beautiful beatnik prose.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œSettler's Songâ€</strong> begins with a sentimental and folksy guitar guitar riff which <strong>Bateman</strong>'s vocals cut through.Â  Gradually atmospheric textures and percussion (really, it'sÂ  just a few well placed clicks) flush out the sound. Â  <strong>Schwartz</strong><strong>'s</strong> harmonies also give the song a lot more punch.Â  But it's the lyrics that hit hardest. They're impressively vivid. Â  Phrases such as, <em>â€œI wanna hear my shit pumping from an SUV down a side street bend,â€</em> sound a bit funny in Bateman's signature Appalachian drawl but try and look beyond the irony, because this isn't The Gourds' cover of Snoop Dogg's<em> Gin &amp; Juice</em>â€”it's a portrait of a neighborhood.Â  Bateman begins, <em>â€œIn the days of Settler's Songs,â€</em> an image which evokes a distant past, but as the song unfolds, it describes the modern day settlers of a decidedly urban environment.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œ</em><em>Babysitters feed Hi-C</em>\r\n<em>To little foreign boys screaming and</em>\r\n<em>sucking on their sweatshirt strings...</em>\r\n<em>Cracked and torn, faces scorn </em>\r\n<em>Dominicans sipping 40 ounces </em>\r\n<em>Sitting bent up on the metal grate on the nail salonâ€</em>\r\n\r\nThe imagery is fresh and precise.Â  <strong>â€œSettler's Songâ€</strong> culminates with the most resoundingÂ  image of all, a grandmother singing her settler's song to God's son upon the mantel.Â  Evoking a Russian folk tune and the American western frontier, she sings:\r\n\r\n<em>â€œKalinka maya have I done wrong by ya </em>\r\n<em>Is there something for us in these yawning miles</em>\r\n<em>Creases of Ohio, kalinka maya, have I done wrong by ya.â€</em>\r\n\r\nB-Side <strong>â€œWhere Does It Sleepâ€</strong> features Schwartz in the songwriting roll. It's less catchy (read: less poppy) but every bit as potent. Acoustic guitar, electronic textures, and a bowed upright bass provide a solid foundation for the vocals. Again, the lyrics are the focus and because the song is rhythmically more sparse than <strong>â€œSettler's Songâ€</strong> and with pauses between most phrases, it's a little easier to digest each image separately. My favorite verse:\r\n\r\n<em>â€œHe who howls in the wilderness</em>\r\n<em>To pave way for no room</em>\r\n<em>No matter how he speaks or what he eats</em>\r\n<em>He's still an animal in his sleepâ€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Uncles's</strong> debut album, <strong>Replacing Words with Other Words</strong>â€”incidentally one of the most wonderful album titles I've heard in recent yearsâ€”will be released on Friday, April 24th and will be available for free download on Ampeater for a limited time.Â  To celebrate the release, <strong>Uncles </strong>will also be throwing a party at <strong>Littlefield's</strong> in Gowanus at 8:00pm.Â  It's a telling sign that <strong>Bateman</strong> and <strong>Schwartz </strong>have been playing together since middle school and are only now releasing their debut album. Â Replacing Words With Other Words is the product of a many year cycle of writing, recording, and subsequently scrapping original material and the ten songs that made it through that process are spot on.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Where Does It Sleep [audio:AEM092 Uncles/02 Where Does It Sleep.mp3|titles=Where Does It Sleep|artists=Uncles]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Settler's Song [audio:AEM092 Uncles/01 Settlers Song.mp3|titles=Settler's Song|artists=Uncles]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM092 Uncles.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Acts like Aphex Twin may have trailblazed the path, and still others like Animal Collective may be getting more press, but Truman Peyote proves this sound is more than just an isolated phenomenon. The dam has burst and a new zeitgeist is upon us. After listening to their digital 7 inch, caroming ingeniously between cosmic psych-noise and infectious pop, youâ€™ll wonder why the hell it took so long.\r\n\r\n<strong>Truman Peyote</strong> gained some nice traction at the end of 2009 via a spotlight on the track â€œNew Wife, New Lifeâ€ by the Website-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named (rhymes with Bitchspork). The electro-hippie vibe of the song played up to the near hysterical adoration for Animal Collective at the time. It was a nice â€œwe can do it tooâ€ moment, but donâ€™t listen to Truman Peyote expecting an Animal Collective tribute band. <strong>Johannes</strong> reflects on the AC comparison: <em>â€œIn my opinion, â€œNew Wife, New Lifeâ€ is structured in a way more simplistic way than any Animal Collective song.Â  These days everyone is so focused on comparing bands to other bands, and while some of it may have merit, itâ€™s not always the best for us.Â  YES, I listened the shit out of Animal Collective in high school, YES I bought their records and loved/listened them to death, but NO, we did not start TP or create these songs to resemble Animal Collective in any way.Â  Our style is just obviously the direct result of EVERYTHING we have ever listened to and enjoyedâ€¦â€</em> Their latest full-length release <strong>Light-Lightning</strong> is a much more savage, inchoate experience than Merriweather Post Pavilion. Novel sounds and melodies morph at the speed of life, like fetal cells, exploding with alien possibility in an electronic placenta. Songs bubble up, effervesce, and retreat back into the froth without ever giving themselves completely to a reductive comprehension. Often the transformation is violent: tracks â€œFishscrapsâ€ and â€œFiretime = Snowdayâ€ cultivate unique ambient signatures, beats and all, and then suddenly lapse into minimalist or found sound digressions. These songs are not highways; theyâ€™re more like the historic quarter of an old European city, full of alleys, nooks, nichesâ€¦and dead ends.\r\n\r\nThe most exciting songs on <strong>Light-Lightning</strong><em> </em>are the ones where Truman Peyote elicits a certain expectation, and then dramatically overturns it without warning. If the pair, <strong>Caleb Johannes </strong>and <strong>Eric Farber</strong>, produced an entire album like the song â€œBeantownâ€, they could do quite well as the afore-mentioned AC cover band; if they did the same with the last half of â€œSarah Deltaâ€ as source material, they would make a fantastic Aphex Twin ripoff. But they do neither. Or rather, they do both and more, piling invention upon invention like an impossible musical Jenga, having created in Light-Lightning a towering, polyglot structure that should fall to pieces but somehow never does. A remarkable achievement.\r\n\r\nSince <strong>Light-Lightning</strong>, <strong>Truman Peyote</strong> has released <strong>Peaced Together</strong>, a split 12â€ with Many Mansions. The A-side for the Ampeater 7 inch, <strong>â€œMagentadoor IIâ€ </strong>was taken from this release. The four minute track starts hot and heavy with a monstrous, moody synthesizer intro. An overture in minature. Electronic music was an early influence for the band: <em>â€œWe definitely started out with a much heavier influence from dance music (using synths, drumÂ  machines, and samplers), but recently weâ€™ve been adding a huge dose of pop in there.â€</em> The pop makes an entrance about a minute into the song. The synth overture winds down, a beat kicks in, and a singer drops a few stanzas of rock 'n' roll haiku before the instrumental side of the song reasserts itself. The sound is restlessly inventive, hitchhiking from genre to genre: <em>â€œWe used to only play electronically, but now I play guitar, and we tour with Orion Russell (of Lord Jeff) who rocks the drums for us.Â  For our recordings the drums are either done by Wes Kaplan (of the Craters), Orion, or Motoki Otsuka (of Vitamin Seed).â€ </em>If you see Truman Peyote on tour these days, expect to see the whole crew coaxing out this sonic mixer with â€œliveâ€ instruments side-by-side with the samplers. The recording process has grown beyond the original two members as well. Light-Lightning was, <em>â€œâ€¦recorded, mixed, and mastered with the help of our friend <strong>Jake Yuhas</strong></em><em> (formerly Dropa, now Bug Eyes)â€¦.the recording process of Truman Peyote is always a big collaboration with a lot of our friends who are also making killer music out of Boston.â€</em>\r\n\r\nThe B-side, <strong>â€œSteelestackâ€</strong>, comes off a split 7-inch with Turtle Ambulance. If youâ€™ve only heard â€œNew Wife, New Lifeâ€ the ferocity of â€œSteelestackâ€ might surprise you. Johannes remarks, <em>â€œâ€¦.but surprisingÂ people at shows is what we love.Â  It makes the whole experience more enjoyable, keeps us freshâ€¦â€</em> The track begins innocently with a few electronic burps, blips and squiggles. Then a recurring sample of what sounds like a videogame character shouting â€œPower up!â€ announces itself. Again and again and again and again. <strong>Truman Peyote</strong> dresses the sample up with a full wardrobe of effects. Squeaky, muddy, crackly: the sample is reinterpreted through a thousand different lenses and hurled at the listener. Itâ€™s a â€œRichard D. James spinning the sandpaperâ€ moment. This isnâ€™t music meant to doze off too. Itâ€™s howling, insistent, neurotic, and will not be ignored. The brief interlude of classical piano towards the beginning and the gentle synth outro only serve to remind the listener just how brutally their ears have been manhandled. The song is beautiful, but itâ€™s a terrifying beauty, like the open maw of a wild carnivorous animal.\r\n\r\nPlans for the future include a tour with their 12â€ partners Many Mansions in July as well as a tape release via Mirror Universe sometime this summer. So be on the lookout for the tour and the tape, and expect the unexpected: <em>â€œThe new tracks are waaay different from </em><strong>Peaced Together</strong><em>, so weâ€™ll see what people think.â€</em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mike Gutierrez</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Steelestack [audio:AEM093 Truman Peyote/02 Steelestack.mp3|titles=Steelestack|artists=Truman Peyote]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Magentadoor II [audio:AEM093 Truman Peyote/01 Magentadoor II.mp3|titles=Magentadoor II|artists=Truman Peyote]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM093 Truman Peyote.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

It's quite another to dig deep into borrowed nostalgia from the <em>unexperienced</em> 80s<em>. </em>The first is a kind of homage for an unrepeatable bucolic past of Casios and barbiturates and roller skates. It's pretty and a little bit sad, like finding a fuzzy picture of some attractive teenagers you don't know hanging out on a beach in California, or worse, Florida. But the second kind of nostalgia is a bit weirder: unexperienced nostalgia, after all, has bred things as diverse as Renfairs, Civil War reenactments, and the Flintstones. In other words, itâ€™s more cartoonish than elegiac, more fetishistic than sincere. This isnâ€™t a bad exchange, necessarily, especially if youâ€™re the kind of person who prefers the idea of dating Molly Ringwald in high school to the real-life experience of dating your actual high-school girlfriend. To bring things back to music, though, if the first kind of nostalgia is a band like Delorean, then the second is <strong>Magic Man</strong>, a baller group of college students born post-Reagan based out of New Haven and Boston and bound to blow up big in t-minus 5...4...3...2...\r\n\r\nCheck it out. The story behind <strong>Magic Man's</strong> fantastic debut record <em><strong><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Real Life Color</span></strong> </em>(free download here: <a href=\"http://magicman.bandcamp.com/\">http://magicman.bandcamp.com</a>) is so spot on that it reads like erotic fiction for PR firms. Written while the band was <em>organic farming</em> in <em>France</em>, the group proceeded to record the 10-song set on <em>Garageband </em>in an alternating series of dorm rooms primarily through their Macbooksâ€™ <em>built-in microphones</em>! Holy shit, call the laundry service. Whatâ€™s shocking, though, is how great the whole production sounds, crisp, warm, the synths blippy and blurrpy and the vocals echo-y and full. Whoever manned the boards for these masterful not-so-lo-fi sessions deserves a Grammy. Fuck Steely Dan: <em>this</em> is studio wizardry.\r\n\r\nEven though it might be easy to deride <strong>Magic Man</strong> as just what the blogosphere ordered, I would urge the skeptical listener to suspend judgment a little bit longer. For all the links one could make between <strong>Real Life Color</strong><strong>â€™s</strong> sonic palette and any number of other Internet generation phenomsâ€”the pulsating melodic sensibilities of more recent Animal Collective, the chirpy blip-tune of the Postal Service, the quasi-Afro vocal tics of Vampire Weekendâ€”the songs themselves are so immaculately crafted that they could, for all intents and purposes, be performed on Alpine horn and maracas and still sound like a million literal bucks. Blogs tend to latch on to gimmicky affectations (for a particularly egregious example, note recent Frenchkiss band Freelance Whalesâ€™ use of a watering can in their drum kit), in some extreme cases equating a groupâ€™s genre or identity with a single aesthetic decision: consider the fake genre of chill-wave, encompassing artists as diverse as Wavves and Neon Indian and predicated on nothing more than some vague combination of tape-hiss, bit-crushed sine waves, and a melted-vinyl quality to the master. What Iâ€™m saying is that our ears over the past couple of years have been trained to listen for acoustic minutiae rather than hooks or songcraft, the technical components of tracks rather than the platonic nature of the tracks themselves. Get over it. If Magic Man were a guitar-drums-and-bass kind of deal, no one would be equating them with the Arctic Monkeys; by extension, the bandâ€™s effortless evocation of the catchwords of late-00â€™s blog rock is too successful to be dismissed automatically as simple aping.\r\n\r\nSo, the songs: <strong>Side-A â€œDaughterâ€</strong> is a kind of suburban worldbeat anthem, all glitchy drum loops, some rollicking synth hooks, and a propulsive energy that breathes life into the otherwise synthetic soundworks. Then thereâ€™s the voice, which is hardly a voice, but more like the computer-generated composite voice of the singers from millions of other up-and-coming buzz bands. Thereâ€™s not a lot of personality to it, but itâ€™s undeniably effective, sort of like the way mood stabilizers might make a fine substitute for real emotions. The punch, though, lies in the instrumentals: thereâ€™s a tremendous fluency with the dynamics of synth-pop at work here, an avoidance of easy structures and verse-chorus redundancy. Think Tears for Fears with a digital twist and fewer melodramatic gestures and youâ€™re getting close.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œNestâ€</strong> is actually my favorite of the two, a swirling bedroom tribal workout that evokes the gauzy aura of a half-remembered childhood hallucination. This kind of deconstructed pop strikes me as distinct from the overt song-ishness of â€œDaughterâ€; itâ€™s the sort of track you could get lost in for days, an infinitely-replayable 5:42 that never seems to age, like a great screensaver you can listen to.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, then, that mercurial 80s vibe isnâ€™t unremembered, or unexperienced, but universal, not a cosmic music of the spheres, but a more personal music of the synths. What else can I say? Itâ€™s magic, man.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Nest [audio:AEM094 Magic Man/02 Nest.mp3|titles=Nest|artists=Magic Man]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Daughter [audio:AEM094 Magic Man/01 Daughter.mp3|titles=Daughter|artists=Magic Man]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM094 Magic Man.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"The Powder Kegs\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/The-Powder-Kegs-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" /><strong>The Powder Kegs</strong> are a pop trio from Philadelphia via NYC, featuring <strong>Dan Maroti</strong> on vocals, guitar, and keyboard, <strong>Ryan Dieringer</strong> on vocals and bass, and <strong>Sam McDougle</strong> on drums. Their rootsy pop rock &amp; roll bends genres, and calls to mind personalities like Beck, Elvis Costello or Paul Simon.Â  Dieringer explains, <em>â€œour band's take on indie-pop is eclectic, but grounded by a distinct folk bent.â€</em> He adds that their 'folk bent' was ostensibly acquired during their four-year stint as an old-time string band busking on the streets of New York City.Â  But if you want to trace it back even further, you can, to the summer they spent in Vermont working as farmhands in exchange for room and board and taking Burlingtonâ€™s clubs and bars by storm at night.Â  When The Powder Kegs formed in 2005, they were as a six-piece ensemble featuring guitar, bass, fiddle, banjo, slide-guitar, harmonica, and vocal harmonies galore.Â  This rootsy ensemble was featured on NPRâ€™s A<strong> </strong>Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillorâ€”theÂ  same radio show your Dad blasted in the car when you were a child on those interminably long road trips to Grandma's houseâ€”where in 2007 they took home first prize for the \"People in their Twenties Talent Show.â€Â  So is that the beginning?Â  No, because long before the Powder Kegs, Maroti, Dieringer, and McDougle, who met in high school, were making music together.\r\n\r\nAnd now, almost a decade later, they've returned to their roots in a sense, because the band is once again a trio.Â  But they've traveled a long way. Â  <strong>The Powder Kegs</strong> have relocated once more, abandoning the Big Apple for Philadelphia, and they've put another hundred miles between themselves and the mountains of Vermont, both literally and figuratively.Â  <strong>McDougle</strong> put down the fiddleâ€”at least as his primary axeâ€”and took up his new residence behind the drum set, while <strong>Dieringer</strong> switched to electric bass. Â  As Dieringer explains, their sound is still grounded by a folk bent but now itâ€™s a little harder to see, obscured by a thick layer of pop.Â  It isn't easy for a band to change directions so sharply without confusing or, worse, alienating its fanbase, but to their credit The Powder Kegs have settled into their new home and new style with remarkable ease.Â  And maybe that's because in both incarnations they have played orÂ  now play the kind of music that just about anybody would be hard pressed not to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhether it's the reggae inflections, buoyant vocal melody, or Spanish lyrics, <strong>A-side â€œLa Mariposaâ€ </strong>(The Butterfly) has all the markings of a summer beach jam.Â  This song pushes things south of the border.Â  Give me the palm trees, sand beneath my toes, and a frozen margarita.Â  Well, almost.Â  This isn't Jimmy Buffet<strong> </strong>and it isn't Jason Mraz, although fans of the latter would probably dig this.Â  But thankfully it's also got some edge and some substance.Â  <strong>Dierienger</strong>, who wrote the song, describes it asÂ  <em>â€œhip-hop influenced pop trackâ€</em> which is an accurate enough appraisal of a song which manages to incorporate both the rhythmic punch of hip hop and the melodic hooks characteristic of pop.Â  It starts out softly enough, with a lightly strummed acoustic guitar, shaker, and vocals, but hits on â€œ<em>back and forth, back and forth</em>â€ drive it into action.Â  I'm always a sucker for that moment when the beat drops, and â€œLa Mariposaâ€ plays it up.Â  The bass line is brilliant for its simplicity.Â  Just a few notes, but it anchors everything down with a solid and very danceable groove.Â  Anticipating the downbeat, it gives the song a vaguely latin groove, which jives well with the Spanish lyrics.Â  So kick back and enjoy... until the chorus hits, and pushes things in a very different direction.Â  The bass and drums cut away, leaving only electric piano and a somewhat subdued vocal melody, not to mention an overall sensation of weightlessness. Â  Basically, the bottom drops out.Â  Lyrics and groove alike evoke classic pop.Â  â€œBaby, would you love me if I was 15 miles closer?â€Â  It's a perfect chorus, not only for the contrast it providesâ€”the tight but simple verse groove would probably become boring if sustained for three and a half minutes without pauseâ€”but also because but also because it sets the stage for another epic beat drop.Â  Verse two?Â  Bang!Â  Indulgent?Â  Maybe, but damn it feels good.Â  â€œLa Mariposaâ€ also ends on an interesting note.Â  That reggae inflected groove slowly builds, first with a tasty trombone solo performed by <strong>Dylan Hume </strong>and later an entire horn section (read: many layers of trombone overdubs) which grows into something resembling ska, but all the while maintaining that solid bass foundation.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œShake Me Downâ€</strong> is every bit as catchy as <strong>â€œLa Mariposaâ€</strong> albeit for completely different reasons.Â  This time <strong>Maroti</strong> steps up to the role of songwriter, which perhaps explains why keyboardÂ  is the glue that holds this track together.Â  It's a lot less bouncy, but harmonically very beautiful.Â  The band describes it as a more â€œpsychedelic groove trackâ€ which is an accurate enough description although, again, the pop influence is what stands out most.Â  By pop, I mean 60's pop.Â  Vocals are processed to give them a vintage quality.Â  The piano riff seems extremely predictable... until that extra measure thrown in at the end of every phrase.Â  <em>â€œThe world will change the bedsheets of eternity,â€</em> 6, 7, 8, 9.Â  <em>â€œWhat you are and what you'll never ever be,â€</em> 6, 7, 8, 9.Â  But just when you're beginning to get used to it, your expectations are shattered again and the third phrase ends after a conventional eight beats.Â  The refrain pulls everything together well, with all instruments playing in rhythmic unison and then a short break before finding the groove again.Â  The â€œoooohâ€ harmonies that kick in for the second verse give it a little more oomph and keep things interesting.Â  Again, a trombone solo rises up at the end but unlike in â€œLa Mariposaâ€ it dons an epic rather than jazzy vibe.Â  The song culminates with a sing along clap along section that brings to mind â€œHey Jude.â€\r\n\r\nSo where is that folk bent that the band likes to talk about?Â  I see it mostly in the pleasant simplicity of their music.Â  Rather than bogging everything down with unnecessary chords and notes, <strong>The Powder Kegs </strong>take an organic approach to their music and allow their songs to develop at a natural pace.Â  The result is, simply put, enjoyable.Â  I've yet to see them live, but from what I hear they put on a fantastic show.Â  They'll be going on tour this summer, and dropping by NYC on July 8<sup>th</sup>.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Shake Me Down [audio:AEM095 The Powder Kegs/02 Shake Me Down.mp3|titles=Shake Me Down|artists=The Powder Kegs]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - La Mariposa [audio:AEM095 The Powder Kegs/01 La Mariposa.mp3|titles=La Mariposa|artists=The Powder Kegs]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM095 The Powder Kegs.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Aware that this might raise eyebrows, they add, <em>\"And it doesn't suck, I promise.\"</em> This, my friends, is an understatement for the ages.\r\n\r\nIn all actuality, their sound borrows as much from Animal Collective as it does Devo, and the torrential hail of Casio keyboards is tempered by a focus on vocal melody that prevents their music from ever toppling over into treacherously cheesy territory. This isn't an entirely new approach to musicmaking--we've heard it before in bands like Passion Pit--but what distinguishes <strong>Stepdad</strong> from those who've come before them is that they're not referencing 80s synth pop, they're embodying it. These guys are genuinely influenced by this stuff, and it shows. Remember that one week when you were 10 and went around humming the theme from Airwolf for a week? Remember that one week when you were 23 and went around humming the theme from Airwolf for a week because you remembered the time when you were 10 and went around humming the theme from Airwolf for a week? I get the feeling that Stepdad remembers both of those weeks, and that they were probably as important to them as the first time they heard Sgt. Peppers. Just a hunch. Stepdad is somehow able to homogenize decades of musical experimentation in a genre known primarily for the pure amounts of crap it's produced, and emerge with something that's almost universally likable.\r\n\r\nThe group came to be in summer 2009, incubating in a sweltering Chicago apartment and hatching in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The results of their fruitful collaboration can be heard on the EP <strong>\"Ordinaire\"</strong>, which is available for free download via <a href=\"http://stepdad.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Stepdad's</strong> bandcamp</a>. The songs for their Ampeater 7-inch are culled from this release, so if you're still hungry after two tracks, there's more to be had without reaching for your wallet.<strong> Side A \"Jungles\"</strong> is the group's standout hit. Opening with solo tambourine, the song ascends on a crescendo of evolving synths, until the beat drops with a drum loop that would make even Jan Hammer cower and admit defeat. But at this point, I wasn't entirely sold on the song, or the band for that matter. The vocals enter with a tasteful dose of what sounds a whole lot like autotune (gasp!) and conquer that precious middleground between awesome and coulda-been-awesome-but-came-out-contrived. Even Bon Iver's attempted use of autotune comes across as less than perfectly executed, but this is the kind of music that accepts (nay, demands!) these kinds of vocal trickeries. It's the chorus that takes this song from good, skips past great, amazing, and spectacular and propels it straight to \"fucking awesome.\" It's hard to get a foothold in this song--it glides so naturally from chorus to chorus that its almost 5 minutes seem like 2, and I haven't yet listened through it without pressing play again only seconds later. When it ends, the world somehow seems dull, like watching Planet Earth on a big HD TV and then looking away at your shitty apartment and wondering \"How did they make TV look so much better than the real world?\" Maybe it's the fact that the song sounds like it was composed inside a massive reverb chamber, or that it would take three orchestras and two choirs to perform live with acoustic instruments, but something about it generates the aforementioned Planet Earth effect. Maybe they should get David Attenborough to narrate their next album.\r\n\r\n<strong>Side B \"Wolf Slaying as a Hobby\"</strong>sounds like the endgame music to every RPG I played as a kidâ€¦and continued to play through collegeâ€¦and still play now. Somehow the combination of lines like <em>\"their eyes bleed while my claymore catches moonlight\"</em> and persistently spritely synths have a euphoric effect not unlike the feeling I get on my birthday, the night before Christmas when I was 10, or when talking to girls with no physical or mental deformities. The tune starts slowly, building ambient synths over something resembling tuvan throat singing, until the verse kicks in with an infectious melody and vocals worth giving a second, third, or tenth pass. <strong>Stepdad's</strong> decision to layer the vocal chorus with a unison synth part is the brilliant move that makes this song almost as special as <strong>\"Jungles.\"</strong> As \"Wolf Slaying as a Hobby\" winds to a close, its rhythmic parts drop away, bearing an almost naked vocal line, totally solo, and sung in a natural register (something seldom heard anywhere in these two tracks). It's a revealing moment, in which we see the wolf hunter without his bold adornments. He sings, <em>\"Now, every time I get a little brave, it bends me out of shape, every time I catch a little break, I'm dying.\"</em> The song's protagonist is at once cast in a new light, and I'm reminded that there is indeed a human being behind this wall of synths. It's a peek into the character of the song, true, but it's also an insight into the brains behind Stepdad, two dudes so elusive that they won't reveal their real names. It's a rare glimpse, and it's a special one. Unlike folk music in which the artist is bearing his open soul, or rock music in which he's flaunting his flamboyant character, electronic music lends itself to a kind of quiet seclusion, in which the artist is by and large hidden from view and the work stands alone in place of its creators. Well, I'm cool with that, especially since the songs Stepdad's left us to ponder are so freaking good. <strong>Ultramark</strong> and <strong>Cobrazebra</strong>, whoever you are, and wherever \"Michigan\" is, good luck, godspeed, and keep it comin'.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Wolf Slaying as a Hobby [audio:AEM096 Stepdad/02 Wolf Slaying as a Hobby.mp3|titles=Wolf Slaying as a Hobby|artists=Stepdad]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Jungles [audio:AEM096 Stepdad/01 Jungles.mp3|titles=Jungles|artists=Stepdad]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM096 Stepdad.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Weeks passed, and I still hadn't laid an ear on Mark's CD. Then one night I noticed a sizable crowd of hip young people (no, not hipsters, just hip people) gathering in my backyard for a vegan potluck (OK, maybe they <em>were</em> hipsters). I went on preparing my own dinner and thought nothing more of the assembling masses. Then, as I was digesting my feast in the living room, some sweet sweet sounds began wafting up through the floorboards. The vegan potluck had turned concert, and I remembered the long lost CD that Mark had so nicely compiled in preparation for the show. The first band was good, but not so good that I wasn't content to listen through the heating vents. The second band was <strong>Saintseneca</strong>. Within seconds of their first downbeat I found myself leaping downstairs and pushing my way towards the front of the crowded basement. This was one of those absolutely magical moments, in which you're reminded why you spend weekends at open mics, why you sift through the dollar record bin at flea markets, and why music is the single most powerful means of communication between human beings. It's worth seeing a thousand Nickelbacks to catch even a moment of Saintseneca. These guys are the real deal.\r\n\r\nIf the term \"folk\" means anything anymore, it means a different thing now than it meant in 1962, and it meant a different thing then than it meant in 1942, or 1922. Folk is a feeling of permanence in music, it's a sense that a certain kind of song is fundamentally immortal. It represents something more important than a genre. Folk-rock, neo-folk, and freak-folk are just bogus terms to describe people playing acoustic guitars who have hair styles of varying lengths. But folk itself is something persistent. A good folk song is shared across generations, and is acknowledged both in its own time and in subsequent times as capturing some barely perceptible facet of the human condition and laying it bare in the plainest of terms. A folk song doesn't have to sound like Woody Guthrie, though Woody Guthrie did write folk songs. The Beatles were a great band, but they didn't write many folk songs. The Band, on the other hand, were less widely acknowledged as a great band, but wrote almost exclusively folk songs. Folk songs are still being written today, and will continue to be written until we cease to exist. For example, Kristian Matsson is a folk artist. Devendra Banhart is not a folk artist. Fourtet is. Panda Bear is not. Think about it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Saintseneca</strong> are a folk band. Not just a band that sounds like a folk band, but a real honest to god folk band. There's a genuine quality to their music--genuine hope, genuine sorrow, and genuine redemption. Seeing them play in my basement was like going downstairs to do laundry and running into Bob Dylan sitting on the floor scribbling notes about Moses and the revolution. Maybe the most charming thing about Saintseneca is that they have no idea how good they are. And so, I feel a little bit like it's my duty to proselytize for their cause, which is about as worthy a mission as I've yet encountered. Though the band officially formed two years ago, <strong>Zac Little</strong> (guitar, banjo, dulcimer, stomps, claps, vocals), <strong>Luke Smith</strong> (trash can, guitar, dulcimer, stomps, claps, vocals), and <strong>Steve Jacobs</strong> (guitar, banjo, trash can, stomps, claps, vocals) grew up as childhood friends in a small town in Southeast Ohio, and played together in rock bands throughout high school. College, however, presented them with limited practice space in which to get their rock on. Little had a stockpile of acoustic instruments, so they decided to work with what they had and began rehearsing as an acoustic band in Little's minuscule apartment. Around this time, <strong>Grace Chang</strong> was pulled into the group on violin (not to mention stomps, claps, and vocals) and Saintseneca officially came into being.\r\n\r\nMaybe it says something about the group's eclectic and yet perfectly integrated sound that its members are studying everything from business and textiles to sculpture, architecture, and musicology. The songwriting process is largely collective, with Little composing shells of songs that get fleshed out and embellished during rehearsal. <strong>Little </strong>told me,Â  \"<em>I intentionally leave anything I do as sort of a skeleton and then everyone in the band sort of rewrites the song when they add their own parts. This has always seemed pretty important, I think you get something more interesting when more minds go into it. Ideally by the time they are 'done' we've got a song none of us could have written completely independently.</em>\" It's this collective method of composition that solidifies <strong>Saintsenca's</strong> identity as a folk band. So much humanity goes into each song, that this overflow of emotion ripples back into everyone who listens. Some bands really require an audience--they feed off the energy of the crowd, absorb it all, and give it back in spades. Saintseneca isn't one of these bands. They're an independently fueled ball of energy (think Iron Man's arc reactor) that generates its own kinetic frenzy and passes it on to anyone within earshot, be it one, two, ten, or a hundred people. This is rare, and precious.\r\n\r\n<strong>Side A</strong> to the <strong>Saintsenca</strong> 7-inch is taken from a mixtape for <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/shoutoutloudprints\" target=\"_blank\">Shout Out Loud screen printing</a>, and is one of the band's newest songs. <strong>\"Wonderlust\"</strong> opens with a driving dulcimer and kicks in with the band's customary assault of trash can percussion (literally, an overturned trash can), acoustic guitar, and violin. The harmonies alternate between soothing and piercing, and inevitably evoke comparisons to the glory days of Neutral Milk Hotel. The lyrics float through the song at a leisurely pace, giving listeners plenty of time to contemplate lines like \"<em>If you could only be one age for all your life, I wouldn't turn a year older or otherwise.</em>\" A simple sentiment, true, but it's the kind of line that turns round and round in your head for the rest of the day, inspiring alternating bouts of excitement and profound sadness.\r\n\r\n<strong>Saintseneca</strong> embrace the long lost art of not giving a fuck what their recordings sound like. Most bands that make shitty sounding records do so as the result of a deliberate decision to create a lo-fi aesthetic. It's all too easy to make a great sounding record with almost no professional equipment if you're an electronic band (ever listen to <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem094\">Magic Man</a>?), but acoustic instruments demand a little bit more attention. That said, some of the greatest records of the last millennium were recorded using a single room mic, and I like that Saintsenca's recorded songs have the same <em>\"now gather 'round the microphone, people\"</em> kinda vibe. That's not to belittle the recordings on this 7-inch--those expecting sonic mastery should simply re-prioritize. Listen to nothing but Folkways field recordings for a couple months, that should set you straight. \r\n\r\n<strong>Side B \"Cold Water History\"</strong> is a gem from <strong>Saintseneca's</strong> earliest recordings. It was one of their first songs, and existed only on a handmade CD that hasn't been available in recent years. We're thrilled to feature it on this 7-inch. A bit more subdued than <strong>\"Wonderlust\"</strong>, it's nevertheless equally inspiring. Built upon a repeated guitar line, the song unfolds from the first verse into a beautiful chorus propelled by unison footstomps and a soaring violin melody atop the fray. Strings and brass are oft-maligned timbres in popular music, primarily because they're so poorly implemented. The arrangement matters, and just as Jeff Mangum found the perfect use for brass on his records, <strong>Grace Chang's</strong> violin is an integral part of the group sound, and turns what might have been a good chorus into a great one.\r\n\r\nI feel a bit like Alan Lomax in presenting today's 7-inch. I'm certainly not the first person (or the first music writer) to discover <strong>Saintseneca</strong>, but in so much as I heard them for the first time entirely by surprise and in my very own house, I can't help but admit that this review feels a bit different than usual. There's a real sense of discovery here, in that Saintseneca's music has since become a part of my life. I really entreat you to go out and purchase their vinyl 7-inch and cassette tape over at <a href=\"http://paperbrigade.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paper Brigade Records</a>. I bought both at the show, and for someone prone to adorning his life with a running soundtrack, they're absolutely indispensible.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Cold Water History [audio:AEM097 Saintseneca/02 Cold Water History.mp3|titles=Cold Water History|artists=Saintseneca]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Wonderlust [audio:AEM097 Saintseneca/01 Wonderlust.mp3|titles=Wonderlust|artists=Saintseneca]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM097 Saintseneca.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Who would have thought a wellspring of world-class pop-rock would gush forth from a ho-hum city in the Midwestern U.S., not exactly renowned for its musical output?\"</em>\r\n\r\nSo begins the biography of <strong>The Orange Opera</strong>, a band from Fort Wayne, Indiana.Â  And sure enough, when you hear their charming, articulate, and spot-on indie pop you might be surprised to learn that they hail from a city you probably couldnâ€™t locate on a map.Â  Iâ€™m not even confident I could locate the state of Indiana on a map.Â  (I apologize in advance to anybody reading this review from Indiana for my geographical ignorance.Â  Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s a lovely place.)Â  At any rate, The Orange Opera started off humbly enough.Â  It began as a stage name for songwriter <strong>Kevin Hambrick</strong> (vocals, piano, guitar) who performed his original songs accompanied by an upright bassist.Â  Everything kicked into gear in 2002 when Hambrick started jamming with <strong>Kevin Hockaday</strong> (drums) and <strong>Bryan Brubaker</strong> (electric bass) and the band had its first gig as a three-piece just a week later.Â  Shortly after their first gig, the band swelled into a four-piece with the addition of lead guitar.Â  The Orange Opera has remained a quartet ever since, although they ran through three guitarists before finally arriving at <strong>Zach Smith</strong>, who joined the group in 2009.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Orange Opera</strong> has earned a sizable following in their eight years of existence, embarking on several tours and performing alongside high profile indie acts such as The Teeth and Dr. Dog.Â Â  In 2007 they were awarded 1st place in Whatzup Magazineâ€™s Battle of the Bands.Â  Nevertheless, theyâ€™ve yet to abandon their hometown and the majority of their performances are in or around Fort Wayne.Â Â  <em>â€œHereâ€™s the exception that proves the rule,â€</em> the biography continues.Â  <em>â€œGreat music can emerge from the most humble of locales.â€ </em> And itâ€™s true without a doubt.Â  Great music can indeed emerge from the most humble of locales and The Orange Opera is a prime example.\r\n\r\nBut letâ€™s back up a second and ask a very pertinent question.Â  Who cares?Â  Itâ€™s not as if some <em>Grand Guru of All-That-Is-Hip</em> sat upon his mighty throne one day and decreed that every cool band has to be from Brooklyn.Â  As for humble beginnings, isnâ€™t that why indie music was created in the first place?Â  To be a rock star you need to be beautiful, well connected, and willing to sacrifice artistic integrity in order to appeal to the mainstream.Â  To be an indie star, you simply have to make good music.Â  Right?Â  The problem is, in rejecting the mainstream, indie embraces the obscure.Â  I fully support the changes the music industry has undergone in recent years which have enabled small bands to build enormous grassroots followings without the aide of a major label but the <em>â€œyou should like this band because they recorded their entire album in their basement through an internal microphone using only a broken ukulele and a Casio keyboardâ€</em> philosophy is every bit as disgusting to me as, <em>â€œyou should like this band because theyâ€™re on MTV.â€</em>\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s why I was somewhat skeptical when I first read <strong>The Orange Opera</strong>â€™s biography which crafts a story out of their geographical obscurity.Â  Thatâ€™s why you should be somewhat skeptical of this review which, albeit begrudgingly, is doing the same thing.Â  Itâ€™s almost too easy.Â  In addition to being from Indiana, these guys met at a fucking shoe store.Â  (I didnâ€™t mention that Â in the first paragraph because I was saving that tasty bit of information for this precise moment.)Â  And yes, their two most recent albums, <strong>Ant Muscle</strong> and <strong>Year of the Beard</strong>, were recorded in a basement, albeit mastered by former Wilco drummer <strong>Ken Coomer</strong>.Â  But thatâ€™s not why you should love this band.Â  You should love them because they make amazing music that will catch your ear as soon as you hear it and after just a few listens, may very well find its way into your heart.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-Side â€œRubyâ€</strong> is a prime example.Â  The song begins with a playful 6/8 piano riff thatâ€™s later supported by bass, drums, and tastefully sparse electric guitar.Â  <strong>Hambrikâ€™s</strong> singing meshes perfectly with the music, his phrasing implying a call and response between instrumental and vocal passages.Â  The lyrical motif of beginning each phrase by addressing â€œRubyâ€ is a great hook, and gives the listener the satisfaction of being able to (almost) sing along on the first listen.Â  The chorus shifts (so gracefully you barely notice it) to a 4/4 feel and a completely different tempo, which gives it a heavier pulse.Â  However the shimmering and spot-on vocal harmonies in the background keep the music from getting too dreary and hold everything afloat.Â  The guitar interlude after the second chorus is a nice touch.Â  Itâ€™s charmingly out of tune and provides a simple but clear melody that in my mind evokes an amusement park carousel.Â  Itâ€™s especially perfecting considering the lyrical content.Â  <em>â€œRuby, donâ€™t you wanna play?Â  Â Itâ€™s been so long, youâ€™re down and out, todayâ€™s your day.</em> Altogether the song has a very, for lack of a more suitable adjective, <em>Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> vibe, which is pretty high praise in my book.Â  And if thatâ€™s not good enough, it gets significantly more adorable once you learn the story behind it.Â  I realize that I may sound a little hypocritical after my critique of the whole humble beginnings appeal, but this isnâ€™t a biographical trick as it pertains directly to the music.Â  â€œRubyâ€ isnâ€™t a song about a girl as I thought it was and as youâ€™re probably thinking it is, but rather about Hambrickâ€™s now deceased guinea pig.Â  <em>â€œI just pictured a day in her life when she was getting older and staying in her pigloo a lotâ€¦â€</em> he explains.Â  There are a million and one songs about girls and probably only a handful about guinea pigs, so in my mind that makes this one just a little more special.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-Side â€œFool For The Gameâ€</strong> is significantly sparser, slower, and dreamier but it retains the same interesting hooks, impeccable pop sensibility, and deceptive complexity that <strong>â€œRubyâ€</strong> and, more accurately, all of <strong>Hambrick</strong>â€™s songs seem to share.Â  Lacking bass and drums and supported only by minimal guitar, â€œFool For The Gameâ€ is by default a vocal feature which gives <strong>The Orange Opera</strong>â€™s vocal prowess time to shine.Â  Here the peppy 60â€™s style â€œ<em>shoo-wop</em>â€ is at odds with dismal lyrics they echo, <em>â€œWhat seemed so right forever is slowly fading far away.â€</em> The song never really picks up but at its biggest moments, when the vocal harmonies swell and the vibrato guitar seem to evoke â€œAloha Oe,â€ it approaches a drugged-out and uncannily happy tranquility.Â  The result is cleverly ironic and complicates the message of the refrain,<em> â€œitâ€™s gonna feel so good.â€</em>\r\n\r\nFor those of you from Fort Wayne, you should feel lucky to have such a phenomenal band in your midst.Â  Theyâ€™re regular performers, so take advantage of the opportunity to see them play.Â  Also, you can thank them for putting your city on my map.Â  Iâ€™ve currently got the Fort Wayne Wikipedia article open in another window and see that itâ€™s a charming little city of roughly 250,000 in the north-eastern corner of the state and has won the All-America city award in 1982, 1998, and 2009.Â  For the rest of you out there, <strong>The Orange Opera</strong> plans to embark on more tours in the future so stay tuned.Â  In the meantime, keep an eye out in the coming weeks, as we'll be adding their albums to our modest online <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/store\">store</a>.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Fool For The Game [audio:AEM098 The Orange Opera/02 Fool For The Game.mp3|titles=Fool For The Game|artists=The Orange Opera]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Ruby [audio:AEM098 The Orange Opera/01 Ruby.mp3|titles=Ruby|artists=The Orange Opera]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM098 The Orange Opera.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Even today, listening to Harry Smith orÂ <em>Goodbye Babylon </em>or theÂ <em>Secret Museum of Mankind, </em>the sensation is more physical than intellectual, a moonshine chill coursing through your lymphatic system, the mingled smell of blood and wet leaves rising out of the earth in tiny, invisible particles. You donâ€™t get into this kind of music; it gets into you. Like whiskey, itâ€™s the infective, curse-like quality of the really good, ancient stuff that distinguishes it from any number of fresher, younger, endlessly subcategorized â€œFolkâ€ brands, kids who think flannel and whispering constitute a workable detour around the crossroads, or that â€œFreakâ€â€”indeed, unspeakable freakinessâ€”wasnâ€™t a fundamental part of the 12-bar equation to begin with. Iâ€™m not down with calling any kind of music-making disrespectful, but the late-20th centuryâ€™s turn towards the easy-listening side of acoustic trad stylings certainly is boring, like if suddenly we started collectively imagining that all jazz sounded like Mel Torme, or that punk rock began and ended with Good Charlotte. Folk is not chill music, it is chilling music. And, more so than virtually every other contemporary folk artist, from the catelepsy-inducing boredom of Iron &amp; Wine, to the fey shenanigans of the Decemberists, to the woolier tendencies of Devendra and Wooden Wand, <strong>Blaque Boose</strong> understand the implicit and electrifying horror of the original craft.\r\n\r\nBased out of the Maine hinterlands, <strong>Blaque Boose</strong> foregrounds the disarmingly eery vocal talents of a woman namedÂ <strong>Sheena Charland</strong> and encases them in a dust storm of fingerpicked guitars, cavernous flutes and some fairly aggressive tape-mangling. The effect is more darkly hallucinogenic than psychedelic, like the middle hours of an endless acid trip initiated in a trailer park and moving ever closer to the busted speaker a secondhand, static-spitting wireless radio. There are no good vibes here, just the aural history of a lifetime of bad lovers and mental health problems. Itâ€™s great, like Throbbing Gristle dismantling the myth of America from a fallout bunker filled with strange, rural preserves.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s interesting about <strong>Blaque Booseâ€™s</strong> approach to the folksy idiom is how true to tradition it seems without sounding anything like what purists might classify as â€œauthentic.â€ Sure, some of the staples are here: repetitive, blues-informed song structures; acoustic instruments all over the place; thick banshee harmonies. But when you factor in the infinite overdubs, the cavernous ambience, the electronic malfunctions coursing through the background, it becomes overwhelmingly clear that weâ€™re a long way from the songbook. All the stylistic familiarities here are based on vibe, not sonic mimicry. Thereâ€™s no fake vinyl hiss. No lyrics about devils and train tracks. No mandolins. Yet somehow, the whole thing captures an unnamable, old-school realness beyond the aesthetic. Itâ€™s a demonic authenticity, like the muscle tremors and delusions of the possessed. You only know itâ€™s there when you feel it for yourself.\r\n\r\nSo letâ€™s feel it. Check out <strong>A-side â€œWinter,â€</strong> an undulating dirge of acoustic fragments and witchy chanting. <strong>Charlandâ€™s</strong> voice has a deep, mystical quality almost organically suited to the delayed multi-tracking of the lyrics. You donâ€™t imagine the recording technology, but a kind of multi-headed medusa with impeccable pitch and an introspective bent. Itâ€™s like being caught in a hurricane in the middle of a haunted pine forest, half-nature and half-magic. The track engulfs you in a thicket of tortured harmonies, a sound collage rendered out of wind and breaking branches and shredded bark. It doesnâ€™t get rawer.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œPast Lives Owen,â€ </strong>a meditation on Charland's former boyfriend and bandmate, might be what Nico would have recorded had she been raised in a one-room shack in Appalachia with nothing in it but a Wurlitzer and some tape-splicing equipment. Less a song than a kind of supernatural field recording, â€œPast Livesâ€ makes good on the dark promises of <strong>â€œWinter,â€</strong> creeping ever further off the well-beaten path of chord progressions and verses towards something more abstract, more entropic, the kind of noise you could imagine emerging from the bored spirits of abandoned farmsteads, the unearthing of something eternal and malevolent. The evil, of course, has always been here, lurking in the shadows, poisoning the drinking water. <strong>Blaque Boose</strong>, like any archivists worth their microphones, are in the business of preservation.\r\n\r\n<em>The Blaque Boose 7-inch is part of <a href=\"http://eternalotterrecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eternal Otter Records'</a> <em>Death Rebirth &amp; Transformation</em> vinyl series, and is available through <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/store/vinyl/winter-past-lives-owen-7-inch/\">Ampeater's Store</a>.</em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Past Lives Owen [audio:AEM099 Blaque Boose/02 Past Lives Owen.mp3|titles=Past Lives Owen|artists=Blaque Boose]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Winter [audio:AEM099 Blaque Boose/01 Winter.mp3|titles=Winter|artists=Blaque Boose]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM099 Blaque Boose.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

We had done our homework, downloading and delighting in their <a href=\"http://sharkquestionmark.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shambling homemade bandcamp EPs</a>, made almost entirely by Shark? main-man <strong>Kevin Diamond</strong>, a real persona and a fabulously nice fellow.Â His band, made of <strong>Andy Swerdlow</strong>,<strong> Andy Kinsey</strong>, and <strong>Chris Mulligan </strong>showed up ready to fuck shit up. Â I think this was probably the first time these guys have played in a proper fancy recording studio together as Shark? and they <em>BROUGHT IT</em>. Yes theyâ€™re a New York band but thereâ€™s something resolutely Cleveland about their particular brand of meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy jamgasms. Sure they're scuzzy and they rock-the-fuck-out, but thereâ€™s an awareness, a slight tinge of the out-there, a little something palpably and deliberately not-normal popping up at every turn that keeps you engaged and trusting in their intentions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the session the band seemed interested in their music sounding shittier, more fucked up, more blown out. No problem dudes. <strong>Diamond</strong> even ran his guitar through what he referred to as his <em>\"shit pedal\"</em>. Why? <em>\"It makes my guitar sound like shit,\"</em> he explained. I have a sneaking suspicion they might even think these recordings came out kinda clean (yikes!) even though to my humble man-ears they do sound nicely dungy, especially Diamond's vocal. Knowing from <strong>Shark?'s</strong> records that he seemed to like the sound of his voice distorted, I split the vocal mic onto two separate tracks of tape, keeping one as clean as possible and the other dirtier than the Gulf of Mexico. I blended these two signals together, along with some hairy Echoplex slap, in various combinations throughout the session. The filth came courtesy of dimming a fancy Chandler mic pre-amp, which when blown-out sounds a lot like Lennonâ€™s guitar on the Revolution single. For many singers, this treatment can come off as a cop-out or a distraction or a deception to hide behind, but something about the warmth of Diamond's voice and his inflection just sounds good like this. Being that this was a live recording, the distortion amplified background noise too, most notably the Strummerish strumming of Diamond's electric guitar, which I thought added a nicely haphazard touch in the mix.\r\n\r\n<strong>Diamond</strong> had the pleasure of performing in our tiny 8x8 isolation booth so we could get a solid vocal sound amidst the pounding of two guitars, baby bass, and drums. That booth gets hot, especially when you're a big man and rocking your balls off. I warned him and apologized for any discomfort; I like bands to be comfortable in my place. Emerging from thick blankets man-steam, Diamond proclaimed that he <em>\"thrives in this environment\"</em>. Listening back to these tracks, it's clear to my ears that he wasnâ€™t just lying to be nice. Everything that came out his mouth was a keeper.\r\n\r\n<strong>Shark?</strong> seems to have no problem with anthems, slogans, big chorii or rock-thrillz. The chorus of their self-titled song <strong>\"Shark?\"</strong> makes no attempt to hide its sheer hugeness. Mind you, this is a song in which <strong>Kevin Diamond</strong> shouts the frustratingly un-Googleable name of his band over and over again in the chorus atop a solid chord progression that hits the bittersweet relative minor in the seventh of eight bars and makes you feel it like a shock in your gut <em>(\"Is it a SHARK? SHARK? SHARK? SHARK? SHARK?\")</em> There's nothing funky, fashionable or guarded about this shit, and that's part of why Shark? has <a href=\"http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=site%3Apoptartssucktoasted.com+shark%3F&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;fp=d059ab474882bfe2\" target=\"_blank\">certain members of the blogosphere semening their pants</a>. The best part? Diamond's voice boasts the power and swagger to sell it. Iâ€™ve heard him compared to Glenn Danzig and I can buy that because he does sound like a fuckin' manly man's man amongst men, but he's no meathead or growler. Nor is he a try-too-hard artsy-fartsy fool, even though I hear some Ian Curtis in there too (minus the fucking brooding). The music sounds effortless, because it probably is for him. From our very enjoyable time together it became clear that Diamond is an astute and well studied rock-fan, and a highly assured conduit for his own brand of natural and assured rock. He knows damn well the game might be hard work, but it's not supposed to sound like it. His band gets it too and they pound out his songs with the focus and force of a demented Crazy Horse, or a polished-up Meatmen, or a less-druggy more beery Chrome.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of beers. Several half-dozen giant beers were imbibed during this session. We call these lovelies \"GBs\" at Serious Business. Cheap 24 oz domestic lagers are the only reasonably priced alcohol in this froufrou SoHo 'hood we call home, so GBs make up our lifeblood. We know a session is going well when the band so quickly accepts the flavors of our home-field brews. That's how we roll here, and these Shark-men fit in like they've been sleeping on our couches for months.\r\n\r\nSo, somewhere between our ceremonial sojourn to the Serious Business rooftop for some conversation/inhalation/celebration, and multiple trips to the Lafayette Smoke Shop for more GBs, <strong>Shark?</strong> geared up--WAY up--and cut two sweet-ass tracks for us. On Side A Diamond shouts, \"We got friends\". Well dudes, you're always welcome at Serious Business.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Travis Harrison</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Shark?

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"ManandDog\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ManandDog-300x195.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" />It's representative of how weirdly smashed together all of our culture is that a band as back porch sounding as Baltimore's <strong>Man&amp;Dog</strong> could have gotten their first big push in an Urban Outfitters contest. It would be bad faith, by which I mean bullshit, for me to say that this makes them any less legit than any other band, for while there are a lot of folks out there trying to make pop music that is Art, they are all still trying to make <em>pop</em>ular music, and a UO contest is as good a shortcut to renown as any. And though the band sounds like a couple of kids straight out of the midwest, with our unlimited access these days to any kind of music we might desire, aesthetics (in Man&amp;Dog's case the dropped 'g's and acoustic strums and growly vocals) have largely become a choice, rather than the inheritance they used to be.\r\n\r\n<strong>Man&amp;Dog </strong>may eschew the electronic textures usually associated with their city, but there is plenty that's worthwhile and modern in their music.Â  First, (it's terrible that I have to say this, but I do) they can actually play their instruments and sing exactly the way they are now doing through your headphones (check out some of the videos of the band playing their songs, there are no recording tricks going on here). Second, the band exists in a lyrical world that, for all its treetops and rolling seas, also includes modern things like turnpikes and prescription pills. Images of the natural world will never lose resonance for us, having roots deeper than anything we could possibly impose on them, but still it can be tiring to hear people who have clearly lived their whole lives in cities and art school dorms rhapsodizing about sparrows and fig trees (I guess it's touching in that it's such a clear manifestation of a longing for something more solid and pure than the relativistic cultural chaos in which we've grown up, but it's still hard to take seriously), so it's nice to hear that Man&amp;Dog are right here in the modern world along with the rest of us. And third, the band plays with form in the pop song in a way that doesn't interfere with the pure pleasure of big choruses and vocal harmonies, but takes those things and subtly stretches them out in unobtrusive yet satisfying ways. It makes the bands songs stand up to a lot of repeated listening without becoming cloying.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, these tracks sound almost exactly the way the band sounds live (although guitarists <strong>Sean Mercer</strong> and <strong>Danny Townsend</strong>, who share lead vocal duties, seem more tempted to burst into solos in the live setting) to the point that if you told me they'd been recorded with the full band all together in a room, I'd believe you. This is a huge compliment. <strong>Man&amp;Dog</strong> know what they are doing. When I saw them play live, there was an atmosphere of playfulness that only exists in bands who are infinitely comfortable with one another and with their instruments, which makes it kind of astonishing that they've only really existed since the spring of 2009. Midway through the set, the band had a brief conference and then paraded through the crowd over to a beat up upright piano to play a song they'd apparently written on a break from painting a house together (which sounds so made up that it's obviously true), a song they'd never played live before, and, leaning aimlessly on the piano and wall nearby, they proceeded to nail the harmonies as if they'd been playing it for years. It was a gorgeous moment, somehow made even more gorgeous by the drunken audience murmur that threatened to drown the unamplified sound.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œAll Day With No Restâ€</strong> is a lovely melancholy strummer with a perfect chorus that hangs weightless above the rolling guitars like clouds in the summer sky (<strong>Man&amp;Dog</strong> have a knack for this kind of chorus; check out their song <strong>â€œBrakemanâ€</strong> for another example). The way the melody first resolves down on <em>hide</em> and then up on <em>die</em> is the kind of little touch that makes pop songs so wonderful. There's also something badass about the second-person lyrics that fits neatly with the roughness of the voices (<em>roughness </em>being something that I mean only to refer to texture, for the singing is seldom even an iota out of tune, even when they break into the big, three part parallel harmonies). One of the remarkable things about <strong>â€œAll Dayâ€</strong> is that while it tumbles along with the ease of any number of folk rock songs, the form is actually quite unusual. Instead of simply pinballing between verses and choruses, the band trots out five different sections over the course of four minutes, with subtle alterations in feel (notice, for example, the way the tambourine enters on the <em>I don't need your medicine</em> section, and the way <strong>Eric Piccirelli's</strong> upright bass deviates at the same moment from its countrified one three pattern to one that matches the new strumming) and yet the song never sounds patched together or composed. It sounds just as natural and easy as if they wrote it while, say, mowing the lawn.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œA Boat'll Abideâ€</strong> has a little bit less country and a little more indie rock to it, from the even eighth note feel and the asymmetrical drum part to the fact that it starts with a field recording of the announcements in a German train station. The verse includes a curveball of a second chord that the band navigates seamlessly and melodically before the thumping bass drum enters to propel it into the chorus. My favorite moment is the second iteration of the chorus, in which the band suddenly drops out, leaving the line <em>we are puzzling people</em> to rise up like a mountain from the map of the song. Lyrically, like <strong>â€œAll Day,â€</strong> <strong> â€œBoatâ€ </strong>hints at love and mortality but remains just vague enough to seem wiser than any single plucked line could illustrate (it's also a well known fact that anything sounds profound if it's rendered in heartbreaking four part harmony). There is a warmth that radiates from both songs, something that comes partially from the acoustic, strumming in the park sound of the instrumentation, but partially from the attitude of the lyrics. The songs touch on seriousness, but they're never mired in it. They find space for wordplay (the puddle/puzzle jump in the chorus of <strong>â€œBoatâ€</strong>) and optimism (<em>There's a road just a little bit farther)</em>. It's a mix of dark and light that makes Man&amp;Dog perfect for spring and fall. They encapsulate the hopeful melancholy of the changing seasons that is so addictive.\r\n\r\nIt's no coincidence that <strong>Man&amp;Dog</strong> conclude their bio, after the usual list of their accomplishments, with the note that they are <em>working on expanding the range of their music in the time to come. </em>The fact that the band openly talks of wanting to do more than they're currently doing is wonderful and rare. This should be the ambition of all bands: to make something better than what they've already made. Thankfully, Man&amp;Dog know this, and these great songs will only be the start of a long arc of great songs.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - A Boat'll Abide [audio:AEM100 ManandDog/02 A Boatll Abide.mp3|titles=A Boatll Abide|artists=ManandDog]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - All Day With No Rest [audio:AEM100 ManandDog/01 All Day With No Rest.mp3|titles=All Day With No Rest|artists=ManandDog]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio/AEM100 ManandDog.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

They're at once a throwback to New York's heyday of gritty blues rock and proto-punk, and a much needed push forward into a new era of integration between Manhattan's rich history of experimental pop music and Brooklyn's burgeoning indie scene.\r\n\r\n<strong>Translation</strong><strong>s</strong> is <strong>Andrew Fox</strong> (vox, Casio SK), and <strong>Stefan Pedatella </strong>(guitars), with Fox's longtime collaborators <strong>Samer Ghadry </strong>and<strong> Dave Harrington<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> on bass, drums, and electronics. </span></strong>There's an electronic element at the core of Translations' music, but the end result is something that truly swings. The musical challenge set before Fox and Pedatella was to merge their respective visions, and to combine the sounds and techniques of previous generations in such a way that paid respectful homage without relying too heavily on overwrought genre signifiers. The resulting musical beast is well-tamed by Fox and Pedatella, and though they each place Translations at a different crossroads on the map of New York rock &amp; roll, the music they create together serves as abundant proof of their successful collaboration. Fox affirmed, <em>\"Yeah, we really get off on playing with each other. And you can quote me on that.\"</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Pedatella</strong> reserves <strong>Translations</strong> a notch on the timeline of New York bands, as <em>\"the next step in New York experimental R&amp;B.\"</em> More than most bands, Translations are accutely aware of their place in history, even before that place has been culturally affirmed by more then a small handful of fans and critics. There's a sense that in order to make successful music in the 21st century, it not only has to be good, but it has to fit inside some unspoken musical trajectory. To a certain extent, all music borrows from and contributes to other music, but there hasn't always been such an overt need to articulate this until recently. It's overly optimistic, pretentious even, to discredit one's influences and attempt to claim status as an utterly unique or seminal performer. It's just not cool. It's equally upsetting when an artist lists a host of influences that bear almost no relevance to the music at hand. I hate it when an electro-pop outfit tells me their music sounds like Karlheinz Stockhausen, GG Allin, and \"glass breaking\". But when a band is able to articulate its place in the great continuum of music-making, my academic sense of order is somehow appeased. I'm at once able to locate their music in some vague context, and to skip the cursory passthrough in which I struggle to put it in line with its predecessors. I'm instead granted immediate access to the musical content, and I'm able to decipher that content using a set of predetermined schema--a process which makes variations on and divergences from that schema all the more appreciable.\r\n\r\n<strong>Fox</strong> and <strong>Pedatella</strong> are enormously successful in reducing complex notions of what it means to make music and packaging them as listenable pop songs. Most musicians with the same depth of knowledge would be experimenting on the fringes of the avant-garde, but <strong>Translations'</strong> ability to apply this knowledge to ultimately mainstream music is both laudable and exciting. <em>\"We want to expand what it is that is our sound, to extend the endpoint that is no endpoint,\"</em> <strong>Fox</strong> told me. <strong>Pedatella</strong> affirmed, <em>\"For us, being creative means taking a folk song from a village in Italy and calling it New York drone.\"</em> It's easy to be \"creative\" and make absolute shit. That's been done time and time again by bands that don't have a clue as to their limits as artists. Fox's statement above has an abiding wisdom to it--that in order to expand one's creative potential, it's imperative to investigate, recognize, and comprehend one's current limitations. Only then is it possible to locate that endpoint and begin the process of pushing it back into more expansive territory.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side \"The Wanderer\"</strong> is a masterpiece of vox reverb, distorted guitars, and drum machine clap tracks. It's the group's standout \"hit,\" and one listen will tell you why. It's relatively easy to determine what makes a song catchy--a choice vocal melody or a memorable chord progression--but it's harder to pin down what makes a song truly infectious. That said, let's take it apart a bit: the vocal verse is more or less a call and response format, interspersed with simple repetitions (<em>\"She can talk talk talk\"</em>) and punctuated with a chorus of <em>\"Ooohs\"</em> arranged to emulate old R&amp;B harmonies. It's these elements in combination that make it one killer tune. There's also just something about the crunch of the guitar that gets me deep down. If this 7-inch were actual vinyl, the grooves would be worn dead flat on \"The Wanderer.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"The MO\"</strong> luxuriates over 5 minutes as it collects musical shrapnel scattered about the song--a drum fill here, a guitar lick there--and adds them to its slow sonic expansion. The tune continues to accumulate new elements until 4:25 when it sheds its skin and simply resets. It's a cathartic moment, and well worth the wait. There's only so much reverb a man can take, and when the soundscape drops out it's as though a tangible weight's been lifted. The fine art of tension and relaxation in music is something that confounds most rock bands. It's easier to opt-in for one or the other and settle for mediocracy then it is to manage a healthy balance between the two, but it's a necessary compontent for genuine musical success. Suicide understood this; so did The Velvet Underground and Crystal Stilts. It's not easy to be as rad as what you're listening to, but <strong>Translations</strong> are well on their way to accomplishing this extraordinary feat. Listen to their 7-inch below and catch them tomorrow, June 3rd, at the Knitting Factory as they open the show at 8pm. I'll be there, won't you?\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - The MO [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM101 Translations/02 The MO.mp3|titles=The MO|artists=Translations]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - The Wanderer [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM101 Translations/01 The Wanderer.mp3|titles=The Wanderer|artists=Translations]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM101 Translations.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Shai Erlichman\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Shai-Erlichman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" />Everything about <strong>Shai Erlichman's</strong> latest release, the <strong>Season Of Increasing Light EP</strong>, is suffused with dreamy, warm light, like a washed out old photograph of someone backlit by the sun in a forgotten summertime living room. From the title to the hopeful lyrics to the spacious open arrangements and generous (but not too generous) reverb, the EP's four songs glitter with warmth and an energy that remains simultaneously relaxed and controlled. Recorded live in a room (more bands do this please) by <strong>Greg Beson</strong> of Manners at the Whitehaus art collective in Jamaica Plain, MA, these recordings are one of the best examples of matching aural texture to songwriting that I've ever heard. The muted, mallet-struck drums (<strong>Mickey O'Hara</strong>) and gently reverbed guitars and keys (<strong>Jake Estner</strong> &amp; <strong>Adam Coggeshall</strong>, respectively) provide a perfectly expansive, airy backdrop for Erlichman's songs, which are catchy and harmonious, like all great pop songs, but rigorously minimal and stripped down to their absolute cores. The spacious feeling this minimalism imparts to the songs is crucial to their relaxed, sun-faded beauty, and contrary to what you might think, making music this simple and beautiful is incredibly difficult.\r\n\r\n(Note: the descriptors in this piece might call to mind a lot of recent blog-hyped, lo-fi, summery rock music; think of <strong>Erlichman's</strong> music as what those bands would sound like if you could actually hear their songs through the cavernous reverb...and if they wrote good songs).\r\n\r\nWith that lo-fi crowd <strong>Erlichman</strong> shares an admirable lack of overblown or maudlin moments, but unlike the sloppy looseness of those bands, nothing on this recording is extraneous or without intent. He uses a dynamic trick I've seen a number of times lately (most effectively and recently in <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem017\">Twin Sister's</a> music, both live and recorded), and one I think more bands would be wise to adopt: rather than starting out at a deafening volume with everyone playing full blast and then attempting to somehow top that at the climax of each song, he lowers the entire dynamic and density level of his set to allow the shape of the songs to emerge powerfully and naturally. It's so effective, especially on a song like<strong> A-side â€œMornings Whenâ€</strong>, which starts out with a stark, droning five-note guitar riff over which a hypnotic and asymmetrical melody slowly unfurls. The first third of the song consists only of vocal variations over this riff (Erlichman has an amazing ability to generate endless melodies over the simplest backdrops), eventually backed by a gentle mallet backbeat and some floating keyboard and guitar drones. When the song finally breaks into a turnaround, it only lasts for two bars before returning us to where we started, building tension slowly and luxuriously. The gorgeous and brief climax occurs over a second repeating guitar figure, over which <strong>O'Hara's</strong> drums play time only on the first half, leaving the second half suspended in shimmering cymbal rolls like dust motes floating in the morning light. It's a gesture of restraint that perfectly suits the song. If the drums had played a backbeat over the whole section, you'd never have noticed anything amiss, but this gesture of removal is so much more original than any addition could be. It lets the song breathe, even as the vocals explode into a high, open harmony on the words <em>there are</em> and then slowly recede into a third elegantly simple guitar riff.\r\n\r\n<strong>Erlichman's</strong> lyrics, often composed simply by improvising until something sticks, are oblique and non-linear, as you might expect from lyrics composed that way, but they're not at all throwaways. They evoke unusual and delicate moods, moods you never would have thought could be the centerpiece of a deeply moving song. <strong>â€œMornings Whenâ€</strong> finds him sitting at his kitchen table watching the morning sunlight pour in through the window, having a simple breakfast, and it manages to express theÂ  wonderful pleasure of simple things like eating alone in sunny kitchens (encapsulated in the beautiful line <em>I will sit and feel what belongs</em>), a pleasure that is inseparable from its own transience (the line <em>I will sit and feel what is gone</em>). It's a small moment that's enormous in feeling.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œThe Seasonâ€</strong> adds to the hazy guitars and sparse drums a pleasant rhythmic tension between 6/8 and 4/4 (notice that the drum part often gently fights against the triplets in the guitar by playing what sounds like a straight backbeat) and a darker tone. Somehow, against the minor key arpeggios of <strong>Erlichman's</strong> guitar, the lines <em>everyone, everyone is happy / and everyone, everyone is needed</em> sound ironic (in the traditional sense of the word, not the trucker hat sense), and something about the way the lyrical sentences never seem to end, running on and on and then trailing off mid clause at the end of both the first chorus and second verse, gives the song an ominous feeling like a day where the heat coming off the sidewalk is so intense it distorts the air. A lyric like <em>the cannibal claws of super applause will have me</em> reveals all the assets of Erlichman's stream of consciousness style of writing. The rhythm of the words is beautiful, and while I can guess at what they might mean, there is something chillingly mysterious about the phrase that you never quite get with more straightforward lyrics. Like <strong>â€œMornings Whenâ€</strong>, the dynamic climax to the song is brief (making use of that same technique I mentioned earlier): the words <em>like a</em> howled out up an octave before the song dissipates. Note the simplicity of <strong>Estner's</strong> tremolo guitar here, which provides a minimal but essential counterpoint to the vocal melody, especially during the louder second verse and the final chorus, where it plays a gently descending figure.\r\n\r\nThe songs on <strong>Season of Increasing Light</strong>, like much of my favorite music, reveal themselves slowly and gently, over the course of many listens. Their restrained beauty and subtle optimism gets better and better with repetition. The other side of that coin is that you should probably sit and listen to these songs once or twice without sending that gchat message or reading that messageboard beef (or, uh, this article). It's summer now; I advise you to load these songs on your portable audio device of choice and take a walk out in the season of increasing light. It's the perfect setting for these delicate, hazy heart-swelling songs.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - The Season [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM102 Shai Erlichman/02 The Season.mp3|titles=The Season|artists=Shai Erlichman]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Mornings When [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM102 Shai Erlichman/01 Mornings When.mp3|titles=Mornings When|artists=Shai Erlichman]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM102 Shai Erlichman.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Just listen to a Nick Lowe album, or the first fifty or so NOW compilations: spot-on songcraft happens all the time. And, like any respectable thing produced in excess, (e.g. episodes of Law and Order: SVU or nice Catholic children) it can get pretty boring pretty fast. Most good musicians understand this. If the radio won the war against entropy, compressing vocals into weaponized siren-calls and cropping rock epics into low-calorie 3:39 chart-climbers, then the pop underground has consistently filtered chaos back into the mega-hit equation, slowing things down, chopping things up, cutting things out, replacing x with y and xy/xx with xxx and y oh y oh y. Darwinism, it turns out, applies equally in the natural and aesthetic worlds: perfect copies shrivel into evolutionary stumps and fuck-ups shape the future. Dig it, the Rolling Stones became superstars for being the worst R&amp;B band in the world, Led Zeppelin for being the worst blues band of all time, and Hip-Hop for being basically the worst music ever produced. In all cases, it was spectacular. Rock history, itâ€™s clear, is less the elegant progression of a master design than an accumulation of beautiful mistakes, holes poked in Marshall cones, decommissioned military hardware co-opted by the bohemian rabble, mishandled reggae vibes, and hissy tapes made on a four-track and handed out for free from the back of a station wagon. <strong>James William Roy</strong>, a genius songwriter, who in his promo picturesÂ looks like a cross between a cool dad and the Duane Johnson of a less-literal Rock, might as well be the authority on pop mishaps spun into metaphorical, if not monetary, gold. This guy writes perfect songs. Then he ruins them. Case in point: The best way to find a great artist is by following the trail of debris he leaves behind.\r\n\r\nOf course, this process of create and destroy can take some time. <em>â€œSometimes I'll bang out a progression, but I won't know what's happening with those until I go back to them in a year or so and see what's worth resurrecting,â€</em> says <strong>Roy</strong>. Resurrection might in fact be the key term to this guyâ€™s appeal, the bottled resurrection of 80s DIY touring van odor, the resurrection of decades-old musical memes that never lost their integrity, the resurrection of mammoth hooks spun out by everyman bands rather than some studio supercomputer capable of turning the sound of guitars into distorted square waves and bass into a physical sensation rather than a series of notes. You can really feel the dew of rehearsal space sweat in these recordings. The choruses stick with you like a shirt youâ€™ve worn to about a hundred shows too many. Do-It-Yourself might be a useful mantra, but Roy embodies an even more important epithet: DIR, Do-It-Right. If someone had played me this record in a car, I would have guessed peak-form Bob Mould. Call it Misguided by Voices.\r\n\r\nIf you, like me, read <em>This Band Could Be Your Life</em><em> </em>about a million times, you can imagine the kind of nostalgic kudos this kind of stuff deserves. The US indie rock of the Reagan years boasts one of the strongest discographies in existence, a stack of vinyl so consistently brilliant Iâ€™d endorse burying it in a mountain for eventual excavation by aliens once the human race has been reduced to dust. Fuck the pyramids. 100,000 years from now, <em>Zen Arcade</em><em> </em>will show up in digital telepathy chronologs as the fifth wonder of the world, alongside <em>Double Nickels On the Dime</em>, <em>Youâ€™re Living All Over Me</em> , <em>Goo</em> and ok, maybe <em>Pet Sounds</em>. But the really great thing about the sonics of two tracks here is that there really isnâ€™t a contemporary analog to it, no blog-band parallel, no micro-movement generating knee-jerk buzz. Itâ€™s not so much that <strong>Royâ€™s</strong> old-school as much as his songs school the broadband generationâ€™s light-speed taste fluctuations, mp3 hoarding, the desperate fetishization of the even-newer-than-brand-new. Itâ€™s timeless stuff, recorded for nothing, signifying everything. In a time when the term indie is virtually (as in <em>virtually</em>) meaningless, this band has maneuvered to the outside by avoiding the outre, stabbing at the center through tuneful grit instead of wonkish gimmickry.\r\n\r\nOne listen to <strong>â€œPaper Valentineâ€</strong> is about all it takes to make it your favorite song of the month, an <strong>a-side</strong> in the most quintessential sense. Not to harp on this allusion, but the hook hits you in the same place as a vintage Sugar track, a pop gloss tossed over punk-honed workmanship, the tastefulness of the vocal track that never sounds stretched but nevertheless manages to nail every nuance. Do I have any gripes? Only that if <strong>Roy</strong> begins moving away from mp3s in favor of vinyl, as he claims he wants to do, Iâ€™ll have a much harder time putting this song on infinite repeat.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œRush Deliveryâ€</strong> marries some wobbly guitar texture to the kind of blissfully shambolic instrumental meltdowns you might find in Crooked Rain-era pavement, the chord changes lurching like an inebriated college student towards whatever mystic revelation happens to hang out on the other side of the quad. Itâ€™s a tremendous mess, executed with the electric energy of live band on the verge of shorting out the back of some shithole bar. Thereâ€™s a humble majesty to this sort of thing, a refreshing execution of every pretentious instinct you could isolateÂ  in 99% of acts indebted to the same lineage.\r\n\r\n<strong>Roy</strong> mentioned that <strong>â€œPaper Valentineâ€</strong> can be imported into Rock Band<em>, </em>which sounds perfect if you happen to throw a lot of parties with an exclusively rock-nerd guest list. Iâ€™ve never played the game, but I understand that it works by tapping out on-screen patterns of notes on a small plastic guitar. The more accurate your shreddage, the bigger your score. But, Royâ€™s contribution has a unique catch. The more notes you miss, the drunker you get, the more off-kilter your vocals and the sloppier your drummer, the higher you climb on the leader-board. Getting it right in real life and simply getting it right were never the same thing after all.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; clear: both; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Rush Delivery [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM103 James William Roy/02 Rush Delivery.mp3|titles=Rush Delivery|artists=James William Roy]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; padding-right: 40px; width: 40%;\">\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Paper Valentines [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM103 James William Roy/01 Paper Valentines.mp3|titles=Paper Valentines |artists=James William Roy]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM103 James William Roy.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">~DOWNLOAD LINKS HAVE EXPIRED~\r\nCLICK ON THE ALBUMS BELOW TO PURCHASE</h4>\r\n<div>\r\n<table align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/store/artists/james-william-roy\"><img src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/product_images/Paper%20Valentines-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300px\" /></a>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/store/artists/james-william-roy\">Download Paper Valentines</a></strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"50px\"></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/store/artists/james-william-roy\"><img src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/product_images/Birthday%20Girl-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300px\" /></a>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/store/artists/james-william-roy\">Download Birthday Girl</a></strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

I donâ€™t mean <em>real-life </em>drama, necessarily, like overdoses and feuds and breakups and uncharacteristically horrible sophomore albumsâ€”although I guess there wasnâ€™t all that much of that eitherâ€”but musical drama, chills, bands that sound like murder. I can think of a couple of reasons for this backlash against laying on the terror: the first might be the Frankensteining of emo early in the decade into something that would make any post-pubescent person blush; the second, nu-Indieâ€™s clinical passiveness, that narcotized monotone that now runs through every hipsterâ€™s bloodstream like a Joy Division bassline. Itâ€™s regrettable, really. If one genre oversold the art of feeling bad, then the other undersold the cathartic potential of bombast. The situation is almost Freudian in its logic: unable to adequately confront lived trauma through music, our emotionality has regressed, seriously, to the level of very small children. Check, Animal Collective connects on the basis that their songs are the audio equivalent of finger paintings; check, Lightning Boltâ€™s dense and manic album art; check, the talent reservoir feeding the Where the Wild Things Are<em> </em>soundtrack. Itâ€™s not really a musical problem, but a mass-cultural one: everything from the popularity of Wes Anderson to the resurgence of tights to the Web virus of adorable cat pictures to the apotheosis of the graphic novel are all indicators that our generation is retreating, with varying degrees of pathology, to the pillow fort. Instead of the bold and the beautiful, we have the fey and the cute. Instead of the Mamas and the Papas, an incestuous fake family who burned and choked publicly, we had the White Stripes, a brother and sister who got divorced. Itâ€™s the key metaphor: Bury the horror, get back to the playground.\r\n\r\nWhat this all leads up to, I guess, is that <strong>Lil Daggers</strong>, a fairly accurately self-proclaimed garage psych group from Miami, are pretty awesome. Whatâ€™s more, their messy, catchy, cocaine-demon style of songwriting is the antithesis of all that is kid-friendly in the emphatically adult world of American pop music. That drama youâ€™ve been craving? These guys have it bottled. Weâ€™re not talking over-the-top, pantomiming, Killers shit, either. These two tracks are almost platonically scary, like the dank armpit of a bouncer at an off-shore casino, or a pile of syringes, only one of which contains anything you would consider jacking into your body. Falling somewhere between the Cramps (minus camp spookiness) and some band youâ€™ve never heard of...er, falling somewhere between the MC5 on different drugs and an electrical storm...ok, falling somewhere between Lou Reed and Stockhausen...\r\n\r\nBut in all seriousness, there isnâ€™t a lot comparisons can help you surmise about this band, precisely because their appeal lies less in the uniqueness of their sonic vision â€”a healthy dose of punk and rockabilly, twangs of surf and noisy <em>kosmicheâ€”</em>than the characteristic snarl that vision happens to be imbued with. You wonâ€™t find a dirtier record this year, a blaster thatâ€™s equal parts party jam and depressive drive to the coast, urine streaked dive and strip glitz for miles upon diamond miles.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œKing Korpse,â€</strong> off the probably not accurately quoted, but brilliantly named <strong>Unmastered Dungeon Sesh II</strong>, has a 40 second intro of lugubrious minor chords and cornball organ, the rock parallel to the lit fuse leading into the crypt. Itâ€™s a builder, the sort of song that lets you know whatâ€™s coming (goofball dancing, shots all around, grave robbing, etc.) long before it actually delivers. Talk about drama! You want instant gratification? Get a ringtone. Like a galvanized bit of taxidermy, the track comes to life in a predictably grimy, undeniably satisfying way: fuzz-filtered vocals, a noodly lead guitar riff, double time snare thwacks. Itâ€™s fantastic, like watching the opening credits to an ancient biker flick only to realize slowly, ineffably, that all the action is taking place live, right now, in your driveway.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œYa Tu Sabe,â€</strong> backs up its hubristic title with a set of opening bars so simultaneously menacing and invigorating, itâ€™s hard to decide whether to head for the fridge for a comfort snack or start shadowboxing. This thing stalks like a feral beast, all the while maintaining a woozy funhouse swirl that leaves you nauseous and loving it. Shambolic does not begin to describe the chaos that ensues. Sure, itâ€™s all tight enough, but just listen to that blasting arc of crash cymbals and skid-mark guitar and some thick gauze of hiss and crackle that makes it sound like the record was pressed on a mud cake rather than any kind of archive-grade material. If the Mission Impossible tape self-destructed in thirty seconds,Â <strong>Lil </strong><strong>Daggersâ€™s</strong> music doesnâ€™t even wait for you to finish hearing it before it starts spinning itself to pieces.\r\n\r\nFrom Big Star to Lil Wayne, Big Black to Fats Waller, the best adjective-noun band names donâ€™t discriminate between the relative importance of the first and second term. Where the noun is fact, the adjective is commentary, always crucial for placing the artist in context. <strong>Lil Daggers</strong> is no different. If drama is for kids, these kids flash the knives and get to work.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - King Korpze [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM104 Lil Daggers/01 King Korpze.mp3|titles=King Korpze|artists=Lil Daggerss]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Ya Tu Sabe [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM104 Lil Daggers/02 Ya Tu Sabe.mp3|titles=Ya Tu Sabe|artists=Lil Daggers]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM104 Lil Daggers.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

His solo project <strong>Boy Without God</strong> delivers guitar-led, moody rock compositions with a Bon Iver soul, heavy on the fusion sauce. But the path from there to here was a long and winding road. Formally trained as a tenor saxophonist, the jazz instinct died hard (if it died at all). In fact the Boston native has a few highbrow musical adventures under his belt, including stints gigging around the boroughs of New York with the likes of avant-garde, future jazz impresarios Andrew Dâ€™Angelo and Jim Black. Birnbaum kept that spirit of experimentation going with the short-lived, but well-regarded Boston Jazz Composers Collective, a tight-knit ensemble of players and composers bent on securing a place for jazz in the new century.\r\n\r\nThe first major sign that <strong>Birnbaum</strong> was inching his way towards rock fame with his band <strong>Abraham Lincoln Brigade</strong>, a melding of jazz and noise rock. Noise rock has always held a strange fascination and allure for jazz and classical types alike, stuffed full of Apollonian rules and modal regulations by day, looking for a little anarchic Dionysian release by night. And you donâ€™t need to hold to the Glenn Branca-line that â€œjazz has stopped evolving and become a dead artâ€ to appreciate what the sonic fundaments of rock n roll might have to offer in a jazz hybrid. Not so much that the musical vocabulary of rock has outpaced jazz in terms of relevance; rather that rock in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century assumed the mantle that jazz had carried so brilliantly in the first half: a total commitment to the live experience in all its spontaneity and confusion. Jazz was born in the hurly burly of speakeasy clubs. Jazz was music to get high to. Jazz was a threat to the Establishment. And white America fought back, either by throwing Clorox-clean, teenybopper puppets at the art form to coopt the music, or by banning it altogether. Jazz was dangerous.\r\n\r\nThese days you only need about five minutes in a jazz club these to see how dusty the entire experience has become, with middle-aged couples tapping their fingers quietly at tables while working their way through two-drink minimums. Rock n roll at mid-century was an exciting way out- the next big thing- but has largely died the same death. Listen to the radio and youâ€™ll hear bands that sound like bands that sound like bands, an eternal recurrence of suck. White Stripes is Leadbelly twenty-times removed. No wonder musicians turned to noise at the turn of the new millennium. If every pattern has been copped, the only path to genuine novelty lies off the music page in the ethereal realm of overblown honks and sticky feedback. Noise is the ultimate cover for new music, a secret laboratory nurturing precious seedlings in a dead landscape. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade, described as â€œequal parts Albert Ayler and Deerhoofâ€, was <strong>Birnbaumâ€™s</strong> entrÃ©e into a post-genre musical dimension.\r\n\r\nThe first formal gig of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was a Boston Jazz Composers Collective showcase. Thereafter the band started playing their own gigs and touring. A combination of guitar feedback, drum bashing and good-old-fashioned yelling at the audience (â€œSTOP FUCKING EVERYTHING UP!â€ was the repeated tagline, a real crowd pleaser) allowed <strong>Birnbaum</strong> to stretch his wings without dipping into the Byzantine modal morass of jazz composition. Good live rock and roll screeching captures the live spontaneity jazz used to have before it became hyper-academicized in the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.\r\n\r\nHis time in Boston has also included playing with local luminaries <strong>Drug Rug</strong> as well as <strong>Eli Reed and the True Loves</strong>, showcasing his saxophone skills with both ensembles. Like good drummers, good brass specialists are always at a premium in a guitar-dominated music scene; so <strong>Birnbaum</strong> has never lacked for gigs, but has been increasingly concentrating on his personal project <strong>Boy Without God</strong> in recent years. Part of that renewed focus has come about due to his not-as-of-yet-patented â€œone minute a dayâ€ recording method. Birnbaum describes it best: <em>â€œThe minute-a-day thing is a creative exercise I've done on and off since I came up with it in 2007. It helps me get over my internal editor, who is a nasty sonofabitch. Basically, every day I sit down to make one complete minute of recorded music (all the parts and all the mixing, so I don't really have to touch it afterwards) and try to connect it to the previous day's minute, creating a long, winding piece of music of indefinite length that functions sort of like an abstract, musical diary. I really like writing this way because it gratifies the impatient part of me and gives me something tangible at the end of every day.â€ </em>Artists use all sorts of rituals to get them in the mood, and the minute-a-day method has been Birnbaumâ€™s own personal recipe.\r\n\r\nYou can hear the fruits of that labor on <strong>Boy Without Godâ€™s</strong> genre-smashing full-length release <strong>Your Body Is Your Soul</strong> as well as <strong>Walking On Water Wasnâ€™t Built in a Day</strong>, the EP from which both the A and B side of the Ampeater 7â€ have been pulled. In Walking On Waterâ€¦ drums, guitars, ukulele, saxophone, plus â€œfound soundsâ€ have been tied together into a neat little 4-track package showcasing <strong>Birnbaumâ€™s</strong> affection for classic pop forms. Attentive listeners will recognize the <em>ba ba-bum chick </em>drum line from the Greasers-era hit â€œLeader of the Packâ€ in our <strong>A-side â€œCity Kids.â€</strong> A raw slow burn of feedback ushers the ear into a sweet, meditative number that mixes equal parts Beach Boys and Justin Vernon, sweet memories of summer love. When the horns kick in, the song warms up and strikes a vintage tone that you rarely hear these days, a lush spectrum of orchestral pop on an intimate scale. As â€œCity Kidsâ€ segues directly into the <strong>B-side â€œCall a Yellow Taxi,â€</strong> you can even hear the crunch of an apple. Found sounds in the form of percussive fruit. Boy Without God brings the sound (and the taste) of the unexpected, but warmly welcomed. Birnbaum seems to be savoring the familiarity of more well-behaved soundscapes, in lieu of the noisescapes or mad skronk of his past. Perhaps the audience stopped fucking everything up?\r\n\r\nLook for sporadic shows here and there, including a Northside Music Fest showcase, as <strong>Boy Without God</strong> puts the finishing touches on a new album, which <strong>Birnbaum</strong> describes as, <em>â€œby FAR the thing I've done that I'm most proud of, and it's the first BWG album where I really got to use all my composing/arranging chops in writing out complex string and horn parts and then bringing in friends to play them, usually better than I ever imagined they could be played. I cannot say enough how amazing the performances are that other people (including Danny Mekonnen and Will Graefe from the ALB) gave on this album. They all just killed it dead. Uh, in the good way.â€</em> Come watch Boy Without God kill it (in a good way) this Sunday at Bar Matchless.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mike Gutierrez</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - City Kids [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM105 Boy Without God/01 City Kids.mp3|titles=City Kids|artists=Boy Without God]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Call a Yellow Taxi [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM105 Boy Without God/02 Call a Yellow Taxi.mp3|titles=Call a Yellow Taxi|artists=Boy Without God]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM105 Boy Without God.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

She thought she was inflicting so much pain by squeezing my arm as strong as she could. Of course it was funny to see a cute little 3 year old try to murder you.â€ </em>So, behind the auditory confetti, thereâ€™s a darker side.Â  It captures the quick shift between ecstasy and agony, the fine line between cute and excessively violent.\r\n\r\nAs I write, Iâ€™m slowly learning to articulate what makes <strong>Young Mammals</strong> so special.Â  Unlike many indie-pop bands, they really canâ€™t be listened to passively.Â  A few weeks ago I made the mistake of trying to listen to <strong>â€œCarrotsâ€</strong> while I was reading a book.Â  Big mistake.Â  This is visceral stuff and it needs to be cranked.Â  A lot of music is derivative of emotion.Â  Your girlfriend dumps you so you write a sad song.Â  But with Young Mammals I get the impression that the music embodiesâ€”no, builds uponâ€”the inspiration in such a way that it takes on a life of its own.Â  <strong>â€œConfettiâ€</strong> isnâ€™t <em>about</em> a three-year-old girl throwing a temper tantrumâ€”it <em>is</em> a three-year-old girl throwing a temper tantrum.\r\n\r\nEven in a calmer song likeÂ <strong>B-side â€œ8-4-8â€,</strong> <strong>Young Mammals</strong> pack a punch.Â  Nearly twice as long and with less lyrical content than <strong>â€œConfettiâ€</strong>, it unfolds at a slow pace whileÂ <strong>Ryan Chavez</strong><strong>â€™s</strong> snare-heavy drumline gives it plenty of oomph.Â  I reemphasize, this is deceptively intense music.Â  Even when the story behind the music fades, the power of the story remains.Â  With regard to â€œ8-4-8â€, <strong>Sanchez </strong>elaborates, <em>â€œI honestly donâ€™t remember what this song is about, it may have even originated when we were in high school. The only thing I think of is the Polar Express. I remember <strong>Cley [Miller]</strong> coming up with that riff and the drum line and those are my personal favorite parts of that song. His guitar part reminds me of a tornado siren.â€</em> So, what is â€œ8-4-8â€?Â  Itâ€™s a ride on a magical train to the North Pole, itâ€™s a bell that only believers can hear, itâ€™s a tornado about to lift your house off the ground and dump it in a cow pasture several kilometers away... Itâ€™s whatever you feel when you hear it.Â  It doesnâ€™t really matter where the music comes from but youâ€™re definitely going to feel something.\r\n\r\n<strong>Young Mammals</strong> was formed in 2004 when brothers <strong>Carlos Sanchez </strong>and <strong>Jose Sanchez</strong> (bass) and<strong> Cley</strong> <strong>Miller </strong>started jamming together.Â  <em>â€œEvery Friday in Cleys room we played music, listened to music and we just hung out,â€</em> Sanchez reminisces.Â  It took a while to find a reliable drummer, but finally <strong>Ryan</strong> <strong>Chavez </strong>joined the mix.Â  It was a perfect fit, as his potent and nonlinear drum lines are an integral part of the bandâ€™s energy.\r\n\r\n<em>â€œWhen it comes to writing songs we all write together,â€</em> Sanchez elaborates. <em>â€œOne of us will bring an idea and we all put our own perspective on to the song. When it comes to any decision we usually make it together.â€</em> Thatâ€™s a very organic approach to songwriting but in reality itâ€™s not how most bands do it.Â  By and large, the bands Iâ€™ve encountered have a leader, either official or unofficial, who writes most of the material and is responsible for the artistic direction of the band.Â  Thereâ€™s something to be said for that approachâ€”with a clear leader itâ€™s a littler easier to achieve sonic consistency, a cohesive vision. But itâ€™s a give and take. With a, for lack of better adjective, democratic band such as Young Mammalsâ€”I mean democratic in the truest sense, a system in which everybody is actively involved in the decision making processâ€”you get something a little more playful and less predictable.Â  With nobody clearly in control, anything can happen.Â  Perhaps thatâ€™s the key to <em>the je ne sai quoi</em> Iâ€™ve been trying to put a finger on.Â  Story telling is the work of an author, but when you get a cacophony of authors the drama takes place in the telling of the story, not in the content.Â  The music of <strong>Young Mammals</strong> is rife with the chaotic energy of four distinct voices.Â  Go feel it for yourself.Â  The band is on tour for the summer and theyâ€™re passing through New York City this week.Â  Catch them at <a href=\"http://bruarfalls.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bruar Falls</a> tonight or the <a href=\"http://cake-shop.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cake Shop</a> on Wednesday.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Confetti [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM106 Young Mammals/01 Confetti.mp3|titles=Confetti|artists=Young Mammals]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - 8-4-8 [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM106 Young Mammals/02 8 4 8.mp3|titles=8-4-8|artists=Young Mammals]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM106 Young Mammals.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

To this I intuitively responded \"hell fuckin' yeah.\" Like any real man he made good on his promise. Ladies and Gentlemen, allow me to present to you this 2-song record entitled <strong>Fancy Pants of Central California</strong>, which consists of the songs <strong>\"Jobs Jeans\"</strong> and <strong>\"Cuperchinos.\"</strong> Trust Graham. He knows exactly what he is doing.\r\n\r\n<strong>PRE-GENESIS</strong>\r\nSeveral years ago, Zachary Mexico turned me onto <strong>Kleenex Girl Wonder</strong> with the album <strong>Ponyoak</strong>. As promised, it was a delight. Graham recorded these very sophisticated, ultra melodic pop songs all by himself presumably in his parents house.  This record came out originally in 1999. Stand out tracks include: \"The Nearest Future,\" \"The Sound of Paul,\" and \"The Mohican Antler Yard Alphabet\". Listen and buy directly from Smith <a href=\"http://kgw.me/album/ponyoak\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>CREW</strong>\r\nSo for those who don't know, <strong>Kleenex Girl Wonder</strong> is historically <strong>Smith's</strong> one-man show, although heâ€™s frequently surrounded himself with strong allies. For our session, which occurred on June 7th 2010, he enlisted a very capable duo of men to help with the bringing of the rock. We had Mr. <strong>Matt LeMay</strong> (Get Him Eat Him) on the drums and Mr. <strong>Thayer McClanahan</strong> on the guitar. <strong>Smith</strong> handled the bass.\r\n\r\n<strong>GEAR</strong>\r\n<img src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Steve-Jobs-001.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<strong>Smith</strong> arrived to the session sporting a sweet pair of what he considers to be <strong>â€œJobs Jeans,â€</strong> those loose-ish and sensible denim pantalones that frequently dangle from the ass of one Mr. Steve \"Jobs Jeans\" Jobs. We taped this session on the day Jobs unveiled the iPhone 4G. Smith opted to not wear the signature Jobs turtleneck.\r\n\r\n<strong>GAME</strong>\r\nSmith lived in the iso booth for this session. The booth can be a steamy place when inhabited by a rock-maker exerting himself. Fortunately, he either doesn't naturally generate much body heat or the new Vornado fan my lovely wife donated to the studio works very well. While he inhabited it, Smith owned that boof. He's the type of singer who knows exactly what to do and does it again and again. He's decisive. It's comforting to be around someone this certain.\r\n\r\nHis songs would be difficult to cover if only because the words would be a challenge to memorize. Who else but Graham would be able to sing this stuff?\r\n\r\n<strong>TWO JOINTZ</strong>\r\n<strong>â€œJobs Jeansâ€</strong> is the peppier of the two and undoubtedly will go down as the <strong>A-Side</strong>. Inject this number into your ear-holes and youâ€™ll find twisting chord changes, exquisite manipulations of language and what seems like three distinct sections catchy enough to be referred to as sweet chorii. Yes, â€œJobs Jeansâ€ might be a good place to start for the G. Smith neophyte.\r\n\r\nPre-take control room chatter slated <strong>B-Side â€œCuperchinosâ€</strong> as <strong>Kleenex Girl Wonderâ€™s</strong> â€œSlint song.â€ Now wait, it was Shellac. Yeah it's their \"Shellac song.\" Special kudos to manly-drummist <strong>Matt Le May</strong> for his pummeling man-beats on this one. Musically, this ominous pounder hits the target but I donâ€™t know if Albini would ever rock couplets like these:\r\n\r\n<em>\"The things we crush\r\nAnd turn to dust\r\nAlways end up blown back at us.\r\nA woman's lips,\r\nA blunderbuss\r\nThe repercussions are thunderous!\"</em>\r\n\r\nI didnâ€™t know what a â€œblunderbussâ€ was so I had to look it up. According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunderbuss\">Wikipedia</a>, a the blunderbuss is a muzzle-loading firearm with a short, large caliber barrel, which is flared at the muzzle, and used with shot. A-HA! Then it made so much sense. Oh, I see. This is for real. I emailed Smith and asked him to send me the lyrics. I followed along while listening to the songs. Heâ€™s not just kidding around writing joke songs about Steve Jobsâ€™ pants. Well he kinda is, but this is one manâ€™s unique voice and this is some next-level shit. <em>â€œA womanâ€™s lips, a blunderbuss â€¦ the repercussions are thunderous!â€</em> Good line, sir! What better way for a man to express the simultaneously terrifying and seductive nature of the lady-piece!\r\n\r\nI took the liberty to publish the full libretto for <strong>Fancy Pants of Central California</strong> below. Follow along and engage yourself. Grasping this artist's use of language will enhance your enjoyment of the music! Visit <a href=\"http://kgw.me\">KGW.me</a> to listen to the entire <strong>Graham Smith</strong> ouvre and to read along with the lyrics, provided by the artist himself, for every song.\r\n\r\n<strong>THA STRUGGLE</strong>\r\nWe'd like to bill this session as <strong>Kleenex Girl Wonder</strong> but <strong>Smith</strong> was served with a cease and desist order in late â€™99 by the colossal booger control corporation mentioned in this band-name and nowadays goes by Graham Smith or KGW or Graham Smith and KGW. But as long as Graham doesnâ€™t mind too much, I'm taking the liberty to bill this session as Kleenex Girl Wonder within these paragraphs. This is the same name that appears of the cover of <strong>Ponyoak</strong>, the song cycle that knocked me and presumably thousands of other bat-eared nerds on our asses. Graham, if the booger control corporationâ€™s jackals hunt for you Iâ€™ll make it my mission do anything in my power to defend you. For now Iâ€™m satisfying my rock phantasies. I recorded Kleenex Girl Wonder and it was awesome.\r\n\r\n<strong>THA HUSSLE</strong>\r\nSmith issues his music and commix on his own micro-indie enterprise, a nerve center called REESONABLE. It will make you happy to pay this site a visit at <a href=\"http://www.rsnbl.com\">rsnbl.com</a>.

While Ampeater was conceived in New York City, our writers are scattered across the 5 boroughs and around the world--South Korea, Philadelphia, and evenÂ Connecticut (that's me). My biggest concern in making the move from the big city out to what in comparison seemed like a provincial community ofÂ subsistenceÂ farmers, was whether I'd be able to continue seeing live music with the same frequency as I had in New York. As it turns out, not only is there plenty of good music to be had, but concertgoing is actually more enjoyable up here than it ever was in New York. Since the market for promising independent music isn't completelyÂ over-saturated, the listening public actually gets excited about shows. The venues are smaller and more intimate, which means that I don't need to show up an hour early to secure a decent spot. Plus, the artists usually hang around and chat up fans, which as a music writer is pretty convenient. The reason this all exists is largely thanks to a fellow named Mark Nussbaum, or \"Manic Mark,\" who runs the best local booking and promotion agency, <a href=\"http://manicproductions.org\">Manic Productions</a>. Their goal is to \"<em>help the best local and regional acts into a brighter spotlight, while proving to national acts that Connecticut is a legitimate and important tour stop by running well organized and promoted, and therefore well attended, shows.\" </em>That first bit sounds an awful lot like Ampeater's mission to help underexposed artists, and so we got a-talkin' with Manic about doing something in CT. Next thing we knew, we're throwing a bash on August 10th at Cafe Nine in New Haven with Twin Sister, Memoryhouse, and a killer local band (TBA). Sweet!\r\n\r\nYou all remember November 11th 2009 as an important date, right? Well, that's the date we released Twin Sister's Ampeater 7-inch, which is still available as a freeÂ download <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem017\">right here</a>. You might also remember January 8th as a slightly less important date--well, maybe not. That's when the giants over at Pitchfork caught on to Twin Sister and featured their first <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/13722-i-want-a-house/\">Forkcast</a> track, which happened to be the B-side of Twin Sister's Ampeater 7-inch. Coincidence? Yes, probably, but we still got there first [basks in warm glow of self-satisfaction]. Ahh, that's the stuff. In his review, Ampeater writer emeritus Jacob Brunner wrote, \"<em>Twin Sister are a true pop bandâ€™s pop band. There may not be any overt innovations in their music, but itâ€™s so well conceived, so well crafted and, most importantly, so well executed that youâ€™d be foolish not to give their music a serious listen. </em><strong><em>A-side â€œGingerâ€</em></strong><em> is a crash-course on everything the band does well. It starts off with a wave of texture so simultaneously diaphanous and huge it feels like U2 hallucinating in a cathedral. Insistent drums pound out a simple rhythm on toms and snare, a tinny acoustic guitar creeps stealthily in the left headphone, a beautifully cheap keyboard holds down the bass line. Itâ€™s the element of restraint that makes the track so successful. The marriage of sophisticated textures with streamlined structures makes for an irresistible hypnotic thrust. By the time the guitar stabs creep in towards the end of the verse, youâ€™re almost paralyzed by bliss. Finally the curtain draws back, revealing a chorus like a wave of melodic reverb. At times it sounds like bouncy guitar pop of the Smiths slowed down to the speed of a slow-moving liquid. In a word: heavenly. They wisely ride out the chorus to victory, throwing in a beautiful guitar solo and a goosebump-inducing harmony of the words </em><em>â€œI love you.â€</em><em> If it sounds corny on paper, get thee to a listening station and revel in great popâ€™s transformation of the familiar into the unfamiliar.</em>\" That listening station would be <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem017\">right here</a>.\r\n\r\nWith Twin Sister come Memoryhouse, the recently dubbed king and queen of the burgeoning dreamwave/chillwave movement. It's appropriately named--this is music to sit to, to think to, to dream to, and it bodes to be a great pairing with Twin Sister, whose textural approach to pop music is refreshing if not revelatory. The best description of Memoryhouse I've heard to date comes courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.cokemachineglow.com/record_review/5146/memoryhouse-theyears-2010\">Coke Machine Glow</a>, and describes their sound as \"a [Brian] Eno vinyl so deep in dust you could mow it.\" I actually have a couple Eno records with the requisite amount of dust, and the statement above pretty much holds true. This is the kind of show that encourages listeners to tune in and drop out, to let the music work its magic and patch things up from the inside out.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who call New York City home, New Haven's just an hour and 40 minute ride on the Metro North, and this show's a great chance to escape the summer heat and get out for a bit. I officially offer anyone who needs it a bed/couch/floor at my place and a ride to/from the train station.

That is where my roots are. But don't tell that to the French embassy!\"</em> The question <em>â€œwhere are you fromâ€</em> has got to be a difficult one for Peglau, a self described <em>â€œPeruvian/French/Argentineanâ€</em> artist who currently resides in London.Â  He grew up in Peru and achieved moderate fame throughout Latin America as vocalist and guitarist in Lima-based indie-rock quartetÂ  <strong>Los Fucking Sombreros</strong>, arguably the best band name ever.Â  Upon moving to London three years ago, Peglau decided to start up a solo project.Â  He began writing in English as an <em>â€œexerciseâ€</em> to help himself adapt to his new environment.Â  But like the man himself, Peglau's music is worldly, transcending international borders and drawing inspiration from all of the many places he's called home.Â  Citing influences that range from Elliot Smith to the politically charged folk songs of Cuban artist Silvio Rodreguez, Peglau brings refreshing perspective to the scene.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œOne Minute to Midnight Dream (So Sad)â€ </strong>would sound a little like the Beatles if you stripped away the disco drums and bass that makes it so damn groovy.Â  You might also have to can the syncopated guitar strokes and lo-fi vocals, which bring to mind the classic reggae recordings of Horace Andy. Â  But I promise you, thereâ€™s a healthy dose of classic British pop-rockâ€™nâ€™roll buried in there somewhere, most noticeably in the melodic hook that beings, â€œwhile I was waiting,â€ and culminates in the refrain, â€œso sad,â€ at which point the dance party takes over again.Â  The lyrics, along with most of the lyrics of <strong>Peglau's</strong> self-titled album, are charmingly self-deprecating.Â  He describes them with a critique:Â <em>â€œI'm always bitching about the system but at the end I always play by the rules.â€</em> The production value is so spot on that it's hard to believe Peglau recorded and produced it in his bedroom, playing nearly all the instruments (guitar, bass, ukelele, keyboard, drums, electronics) himself.Â  He did receive a little help from <strong>Lucia Vivanco</strong> on violin, however, who's sublimely catchy riff accentuates the groove.Â  As you can see, there are a lot of pieces coming together in Peglauâ€™s music.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side  â€œI'll Never Be Alain Delonâ€</strong> pays homage to the film star that <strong>Peglau</strong> regrets heâ€™ll never become.Â  Itâ€™s more than a whimsical fantasy, however, and he addresses a world in which broken dreams are the norm. Maybe that sounds a bit over the top but I pose the question, who wouldnâ€™t like to be Alain Delon?Â  This guy was the French James Dean, only he lived long enough to relish in the spotlight and enjoy flings with supermodels across the European continent.Â  <em>â€œPeople tell us the future is ours to change but I can't change it,â€</em> Peglau sings, <em>â€œand neither you nor your friends.â€</em> The question that Peglau seems to be getting at is whether we're masters of our own destinies or whether our lives are predetermined.Â  Heavy stuff, but it's masked behind a groove so fat and a vocal melody so catchy that you might not notice on the first listen.Â  Itâ€™s a common trait in Peglauâ€™s songs, which rarely let serious subject matter get in the way of a good time.Â  The chorus hits hard with a classic rock chord progression and crunchy guitars.Â  The second verse is backed by an absolutely infectious synthesizer hook, while the samples from a Delon interview, in which he explains the role he so often playedâ€”<em>le solitaire</em>, the mysterious and dashingly handsome lonerâ€”spice things up later on.\r\n\r\nWhile<strong> Peglau</strong> has lived in London for several years now, to say that he's settled down would be a bit deceptive.Â  He gigged recently in Mexico City and Lima in addition to London and a trip to Buenos Aires is already in the works for the coming year.Â  I find that to be one of the most intriguing things about him.Â  While pop stars can tour internationally and let their record labels foot the bill, watching the world go by from the comfortable vantage point of a private jet, the independent musician's tour is typically constrained by the price of gasoline and the amount of time it takes the van to break down.Â  Peglau<strong> </strong>evades this problem by playing with a different band in every city he tours.Â  <em>â€œThis is a good way of solving one of the biggest problems when you tour, transportation costs,â€</em> he explains.Â  <em>â€œAnd it's a great way of making friends. It's a little bit stressful to rehearse in 3 days the whole repertoire but until now it has worked.â€ </em>But it's more than budget that constrains the majority of indie acts to a single country and quite often, a single city.Â  These are typically bands that build grassroots followings through consistent gigging in a concentrated area.Â  And, well, it's pretty fucking difficult to do that if you're spread between continents.Â  How many times have you seen a out of town band that's hot shit in its home city playing for a crowd of 5 or 6 on their first out of state tour?Â  It's not that these bands aren't hot shit, they've simply yet to achieve a geographically diverse following.Â  So how does Peglau do it?Â  Part of the answer may lie in the fact that his shit is absolutely steaming but part of it lies in his creative use of multimedia and online distribution.\r\n\r\n<strong>Peglau</strong> has recently begun creating low budget but highly entertaining videos to accompany his music.Â  <em>â€œThe idea is to work in a single format, with a video for every song,â€</em> he explains.Â  <em>â€œWe try not to be pretentious and just have fun. And we always get some help from friends. It is just a labor of love....â€</em> The love is pretty evident--just check out the videos for <strong>â€œOne Minute to Midnight Dream (So Sad)â€ </strong>and <strong>â€œI'll Never Be Alain Delonâ€</strong> and you'll see what I mean.Â  The former begins with a shot of Peglau taking a comically oversized pill from a bottle marked â€œSweet Dreams?â€ Hallucinations and dance sequences ensue.Â  The latter<strong> </strong>is a mock trailer shot in black and white to evoke Delon's classic films. Â Itâ€™s chocked full of all the scenes that make a good trailerâ€”the kisses, the slaps, the gunshotsâ€”exaggerated to hilarious extents.Â  These videos are produced and directed the help of wife <strong>Maria Elena de Losada</strong> who incidentally sings background on several of Peglauâ€™s songs and whom, for reasons rational or not, I imagine looking like Penelope Cruz's character of the same name in Vicky Christina Barcelona. Â  They share a charming home-video aesthetic but when it comes down to it, theyâ€™re a lot better than any home video Iâ€™ve seen recently, resembling more closely the work of a professional trying (and succeeding) to be cute than the work of an actual amateur.\r\n\r\nAll of <strong>Peglauâ€™s</strong> videos are available on youtube.com and heâ€™s made his entire album available at bandcamp.com for free.Â  In addition to the above mentioned sites, heâ€™s relied heavily on blogs to disseminate his music throughout the world.Â  It seems Peglau has learned better than just about any other musician out there how to utilize the internet.Â  Through his innovative and decidedly non-commercial approach heâ€™s made his music available to all, and that could be a big part of the reason he can fill clubs in all corners of the world. Â  He isn't just making great musicâ€”he's pioneering a new path to becoming an internationally successful musician.Â  I supsect that in the decades to come we'll see a lot more artists following this path. Peglau's just a bit ahead of the times.Â  With this review I hope to introduce him to a primarily American audience.Â  Let's just hope the French embassy isn't reading.Â  We wouldn't want to have one of those passports revoked...\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - One Minute to Midnight Dream (So Sad) [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM107 Francois Peglau/01 One Minute to Midnight Dream (So Sad).mp3|titles=One Minute to Midnight Dream (So Sad)|artists=Francois Peglau]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - I'll Never Be Alain Delon [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM107 Francois Peglau/02 Ill Never Be Alain Delon.mp3|titles=Ill Never Be Alain Delon|artists= Francois Peglau]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM107 Francois Peglau.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Woodsman\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Woodsman-300x298.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"298\" />Quite a bit of the press on Denver, CO quartet <strong>Woodsman</strong> leans towards discussions of longish songs and instrumental jamminess, two musical qualities that might be notable if you think Tangerine Dream and the String Cheese Incident belong on the same bill by virtue of their thematically foodie names. Of course, in situations where longish, jammy music is appropriate, length and jamminess turn out, ironically, to be the <em>least</em> notable points of interest. Like a film review describing a Holocaust documentary as â€œdarkâ€ and â€œhistorical,â€ itâ€™s like <em>tell me something I donâ€™t know</em>! Whoever is there came prepared. The biggest problem faced by any band pushing supertight guitar-and-drums instrumentals, vulnerable to the metaphysical trappings of â€œpost-rockâ€ (as if rock had a metaphysics to begin with), whose notions of song-structure place vibe above parts a, b and c is a categoric rather than a creative one. Imagine, for the sake of argument, that instead of the <em>Nuggets</em> anthology, there was something similarly enormous and comprehensive called <em>Noodles</em>: <em>Bands That Didnâ€™t Know When to Stop</em> <em>1965-1979</em>. Itâ€™s a terrifying prospect, imagining a Kilimanjaro-sized stack of vinyl, two songs to a side, â€œpackagedâ€ in 200 acres of pristine Vermont farmland. I point all this out because Woodsman, despite their bucolic namesake, are percolating a very different kind of longishness and jamminess than either term would have you believe outright, something closer to Dusseldorf than Dartmouth, something that demands your zone-outs with an urgency thatâ€™s almost political.\r\n\r\nI got into this band backwards, seeing them live without foreknowledge and then digging into their Internet presence in the aftermath. To say something is lost in translation between the stage and the silicon isnâ€™t a dis by any means, just the acknowledgement that different acts inevitably have their ideal mediums and <strong>Woodsmanâ€™s</strong> happens to be packed, million-degree basements where the collective sweat of some two-hundred odd strangers actually acts as an electro-spiritual conduit for an almighty suburban Shango. The setup is ritualistically symmetrical, two guitarists and two drummers in a square configuration like telephone poles in a cornfield. Operating like the worldâ€™s simplest circuit, these guys loop the voltage for forty-five killer minutes while the collective brain hovering invisibly over the rafters draws an infinite series of connecting doodles between them. Itâ€™s a powerful thing, shuddering reverb distress signals undercut by rapidly complicating motorik patterns and vocals like ghosts in some superlatively advanced German-made machine. How long were these songs? I didnâ€™t check my watch once.\r\n\r\nCompressing this kind of physical sensationalism into something you can own and play at home is certainly no small task. Smartly, <strong>Woodsmanâ€™s</strong> recordings are different enough from their show tunes as to discourage direct comparison. For one, theyâ€™re softer. For two, theyâ€™re cleaner. Think of a pristinely rendered two-dimensional blueprint viewed with the understanding that some day it will become a house you can inhabit. Theyâ€™re kind of like that, a concise symbolic language for communicating and making permanentÂ  the ephemeral, a work of taxidermy designed to inspire admiration for the animal, alive and in its native habitat. Both <strong>â€œBeachedâ€</strong> and <strong>â€œBalanceâ€</strong> come off the five-song <strong>Mystery Tape EP</strong> that was released on Lefse records earlier this month.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s great about these tracks (both at the virtually radio-friendly durations of 4:41 and 4:37, respectively) is how they communicate the tension-wire tautness of the groupâ€™s gigs into a domestic night-terror, exchanging volume for eeriness and echo, distortion for space and clarity. From the submarine siren guitar on <strong>â€œBeachedâ€</strong> to the skittery forrest-floor rhythms on <strong>â€œBalanceâ€</strong>, the band allows unknowable evil presences to maneuver unchained through its etherized instrumental atmospheres. Post-rock has burdened itself with a number of distasteful connotations over the past two decades, but where other groups come off as embarrassingly bathetic (Explosions in the Sky) or comically overblown (Fucking Champs) or disingenuously mopey (Mogwai), <strong>Woodsman</strong>â€”like Neu! or Harmoniaâ€”comprehend the cumulative value of restraint, repetition, the acid-streak euphoria you get from listening to the same hypnotic ritual again and again. What if â€œKick out the Jamsâ€ had been a literal and clairvoyant criticism of every air-sucking, self-indulgent rock act ever to grace the festival circuit in its wake? Woodsman is the hypothetical heir to that alternate reading, a repossession of the epic in the name of the simply exceptional.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Beached [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM108 Woodsman/01 Beached.mp3|titles=Beached|artists=Woodsman]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Balance [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM108 Woodsman/02 Balance.mp3|titles=Balance|artists=Woodsman]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM108 Woodsman.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

In it, color and grayscale are mixed freely. Perspectives crash into one another, creating a mindfuck of Escher-esque intensity, only without that cute, logic-puzzle element of resolution. Photographs and drawings and computer graphics join forces to create single figures. Ragged edges show. Enormous pencils rain down on a boat that looks to have arrived directly from a renaissance painting. A man drowns another in a pond next to what looks sort of like a filled in multiple choice test. Scientists cribbed from a technicolor film still point to a hand drawn arrow. Stray ink splotches show around the letters that make up the band name, remnants from stamps. It's loose and surreal and unpredictable, but it somehow manages to sustain a consistent mood: an eerie melange of pulp novels, playful non-sequitors, conspiracy theories and David Lynch's nauseous unreality, tempered with the occasional moment of beautiful clarity. It's one of the things I've always admired about Hallelujah the Hills, because it manages to be a perfect illustration of what the band sounds like. Rough-edged, surreal, funny, eerie, packed with lyrics that sound like they were lifted from a pamphlet run off in someone's basement, and dotted with those moments of epiphany (said epiphanies being created by ingenious arranging touches and/or stirring, shouted choruses). For example, there's the moment in <strong>â€œAllied Lionsâ€</strong> (a track from the bands most recent album, <strong>Colonial Drones</strong>) in which a frothy, building rock song suddenly disappears, leaving the line <em>everything's a dream except for this moment we're in now</em> hanging over the void, the lyric broken into three equal parts with audibly different effects on each, collage-style. Then an alarm clock rings.\r\n\r\nThe art and the songs are both the product of the mind of lead singer <strong>Ryan Walsh</strong>, formerly ofÂ  <strong>The Stairs</strong>, though the arranging is done by the full band together, who between the seven of them can cover all the usual rock band bases with the addition of trumpet, trombone, cello and sampler. The arrangements are often what catapult the songs out of the realm of rock-with-smart-and-weird-lyrics into a fully formed, coherent, mood-inducing sound, complete with the occasional epic crescendo, for which, as we all know by now, I am a grade A sucker. Take their Ampeater <strong>B-side â€œThat Ticking Sound You Hear,â€</strong> which commences with some minimal two-note guitar strumming, the gentlest mallet-struck cymbals, and a cascading melody fragment that's <strong>Walsh</strong> at his softest and most lyrical. After making a brief appearance earlier, muted trumpet and cello appear to punctuate the lines <em>out of context / on a substance </em>with startling clusters that disappear just as fast as they arrived. Like <strong><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem102\">Shai Erlichman's</a><em> </em></strong>songs, the moment is memorable for what it leaves out (the parallel clusters that don't appear after the next two lines) as for what it contains. Soon afterward there is a rising, discordant guitar and trumpet trill which dies into a found sound squeal which abruptly breaks into a bridge that sounds tailor-made for some pounding drums and enormous guitars. Instead, we get more high pitched noises and arhythmic cymbals that fight the core of the song in a way that makes its ominous lyrics all the more ominous, and the full band crash we'd expect is reserved for the very last repeating chorus, where its anthemic potential runs up against the fact that the last repeating chorus is built in elusive five-bar phrases. The arrangement is brilliant because <strong>â€œTickingâ€</strong> isn't a song that should soar. It's the lament of a conspiracy theorist who's either correct or batshit crazy, and either way things aren't going to turn out well. Even in the last moments of the song, when the vocals have landed safely on the root, the tension remains in the trumpet, which hangs on the major 7 and refuses to resolve upwards the way our western ears want it to.\r\n\r\n<strong>Walsh's</strong> lyrics are full of brilliant and rhythmic one-liners like <em>the master painters all look ashamed / they donâ€™t know the thrill of a jukebox fade,</em> which call to mind the non sequiturs of The Silver Jews' David Berman, with whom <strong>Hallelujah the Hills</strong> has shared bills (and shares some stylistic markers), only steeped in disaster movies instead of wry, cowboy toughness, and John Ashbery poems instead of whiskey. This attention to words (I have it on good authority that Walsh has been known to perform â€œGoogle Purity tests,â€ a concept coined and invented by Berman which involves searching for lyrical ideas to make sure that they are entirely original)Â pays off in spades, for where most bands in the indie rock world get stuck exploring the same ideas with the same words and making them sound cool via loud guitars or some such, Hallelujah the Hills's lyrics are full of couplets that are clever and funny and touching and use words that you have probably not recently heard in a rock song, like, say, <em>documentarian </em>or <em>cohorts, </em>without sacrificing any of the rhythm that lyrics have to have to carry a rock song<em>. </em>AND they have loud guitars. What more could you ask for?\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œIntroductory Saintsâ€</strong> (another classic <strong>Hallelujah the Hills</strong> title) showcases the less moody side of the band, laying those propulsive lyrics over a bouncy backbeat, garnished with some some light country (those twangy lead lines over in your left ear, the way the melody dips from the root up an octave at the end of the chorus, that last ringing major 6 chord) and soul-pop touches (organ smears, those repeating guitar stabs in your right ear, the fat brass longtones), and ending in the Hallelujah the HillsÂ staple of an enormous, rousing gang-vocal chorus (something about Walsh's trebly voice becomes electric when he jumps up the octave into a shout at a climactic moment; it always gets me, (you can also hear it leaping out from the gang vocal mix on <strong>Titus Andronicus' The Monitor</strong>). From the first line, this song really brings out the way Walsh's lyrics fit together just loosely enough to leave endless space open for potential meaning. The opening couplet of <em>Gentlemen / he said forever</em> opens so many possibilities it's easy to project your own meanings onto it, something that's so often true of his songs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hallelujah the Hills</strong> have released these two songs to celebrate their departure on a summer tour opening for <strong>Titus Andronicus</strong> (who members of Hills will also be joining onstage to provide cello, brass, keys and gang vocals), a one two punch you'd be wise to check out. With so many members, Hallelujah The Hills have the ability live to create an enormous, euphoric wall of sound, especially when all of the members are not only playing at top volume but shouting a big, unison hook that hangs over the entire room. You'll find it hard not to feel the upward pull of those enormous clouds of melody, and it will bring a little joy to your heart.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tour dates</strong>\r\nJuly 8 â€“ Allston, MA â€“ Great Scott\r\nJuly 9 â€“ Brooklyn, NY â€“ Union Hall\r\nJuly 10 â€“ New Haven, CT â€“ Lily's Pad*\r\nJuly 11 â€“ Northampton, MA â€“ Pearl Street*\r\nJuly 12 â€“ Albany, NY â€“ Valentine's*\r\nJuly 13 â€“ Buffalo, NY â€“ Ninth Ward at Babeville*\r\nJuly 14 â€“ Toronto, ON â€“ Horseshoe Tavern*\r\nJuly 15 â€“ Grand Rapids, MI â€“ Intersection Lounge*\r\nJuly 16 â€“ Chicago, IL â€“ Subterranean*\r\nJuly 18 â€“ Youngstown, OH â€“ Lemon Grove Cafe\r\n* = Opening for Titus Andronicus\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Introductory Saints [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM109 Hallelujah the Hills/01 Introductory Saints.mp3|titles=Introductory Saints|artists=Hallelujah the Hills]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - That Ticking Sound You Hear [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM109 Hallelujah the Hills/02 That Ticking Sound You Hear.mp3|titles=That Ticking Sound You Hear|artists=Hallelujah the Hills]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM109 Hallelujah the Hills.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

My New York isn't Your New York, and it's definitely not His or Her New York, or god forbid, That Guy's New York. Most people carve a comfortable space for themselves that's situated between the extremes of Gotham City's criminal dystopia, Sex &amp; The City's 5th ave glitz, and GG Allin's East Village nest of debauchery. Somewhere in this mess of fictional bubbles is an objective portrait of the city at large that accounts for the millions of people struggling to reconcile their fantastic projections of life in the big city with the reality that most of us wake up, go to work, do some shit, go home, eat some shit, and go to bed. We value good art as a culture because it pulls us just a little bit outside this reality and into the liminal space that separates the daily grind from what we always thought life would be like \"when we grew up.\" That's good art, but truly <em>great</em> art keeps us there long enough to grasp whole handfuls of fantasy. It's a precious thing. The dream isn't to escape the metropolis but to feel like we're living inside some highly stylized version of it that could only exist in someone's head, and for but a moment at that. Filmmakers have it easy, they can literally mold a world and present it to viewers, and writers have hundreds of pages to describe and expand upon their thoughts, but songwriters have a meager 2 to 5 minutes to do the same, and so pop songs seldom grant listeners this level of creative freedom. But when I hear <strong>Hank and Pigeon</strong>, I imagine two people, living in a New York that's not mine and can never be mine; a New York in which pigeons become trapped inside apartment walls, in which people stand on opposite street corners talking on the phone, in which songs are written like letters to a friend, and in which all of this can be boiled down into a simple melody.\r\n\r\n<strong>Morgan Heringer</strong> and <strong>Alex Wernquest</strong> hardly knew one another when they began the odd practice of songwriting as correspondence. Wernquest had a background in blues guitar; Heringer in jazz vocal music and composition. The story of <strong>Hank and Pigeon</strong> tows the line between truth and fiction in so much as the truth is so perfect that it's hardly believeable. When Bob Dylan first came to New York City he claimed to have been born from a Cherokee mother who abandoned him at birth with a traveling circus coming throughÂ New Mexico, so compared to that it's believeable, but it nevertheless reads like the kind of urban fairytale that I'd expect to resurface as the plot of a quirky Swedish art film or animated short at Sundance. Heringer and Wernquest had played together in a band, but not the kind of band that sleeps in a touring van together--rather, the kind that hangs out every once in a while to record and play the occasional gig. They happened to be on the phone discussing one such gig when they met at opposite street corners in Manhattan. It would have been a simple matter to hang up and continue the conversation in person, but the two stood there in plain sight, talking. Add rain and replace Wernquest with John Cusack and you've got yourself a PG-13 romanic comedy. The incident, however cute in retrospect, went unnoticed by Wernquest until he showed up to an open-mic at the Sidewalk Cafe. Heringer took the stage, and as Wernquest sat listening he heard a line float by that went something like, <em>\"The things you say to me on the other side of the street.\"</em> Heringer had taken their conversation, or rather the situation surrounding it, and turned it into a song. But it wasn't just a song. It was a song to him, a song for him, and an invitation of sorts. Wernquest did the only thing he could--he wrote a song back. And Heringer wrote a song back. And so they became Hank and Pigeon.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hank and Pigeon</strong> is two voices, very much separate but interminably attune to one another. Each song is identifiablyÂ a Hank <em>or</em> Pigeon composition, usually according to the principle vocalist. There's a consistency to their songs, even though each writes with a wholly different background and approach. Heringer's songs are often modal, with chords expressive of her background in jazz. She writes on the ukulele, which as a relatively new instrument in her repertoire, affords her the opportunity to experiment with chords and harmonies that wouldn't necessarily occur to her otherwise. Wernquest's background in blues draws him towards more basic harmonic structures with an emphasis on the interaction between vocals and accompaniment. The variety of sentiments and moods that the two are capable of creating is extraordinary, and since each lends his or her finishing grace to the other's compositions, the album reads like letters written by one and edited by the other such that both voices are always present but in varying roles. While sitting together during an open mic, the two began jotting down ideas and phrases, just little mental snippits. Unplanned, each went home and wrote a song based on their collective brain droppings that evening. Heringer wrote \"<strong>Feathers and Fur,\" the B-side</strong> of this digital 7-inch, and Wernquest wrote <strong>\"When Will We Become,\"</strong> the closing track on their <a href=\"http://hankandpigeon.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">phenomenal donation-optional album available on Bandcamp</a>. One listen will tell you that theirs is a special kind of collaboration, different from the great songwriting pairs that come to mind, but somehow also better. Recurring themes run through their songs, most of them shared stories between Heringer and Wernquest that through the course of the album implant themselves upon listeners. As these little quirks reveal themselves to us, we get closer and closer to Hank and Pigeon, until we become a part of the discussion, watching their conversation unfold while taking part in it ourselves.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side \"In the Ridge\"</strong> introduces us to the pigeon character. <strong>Heringer</strong> and <strong>Wernquest</strong> sing, <em>\"I'm a pigeon and I'm living in the ridge between the walls.\"</em> It's born of a true story, in which Wernquest consistently woke to strange sounds within the walls of his apartment, and imagined that such cacophany could only be caused by a pigeon flying around inside. From an academic perspective, this whole scenario situates Wernquest on the edge of a fictional Kafka-esque New York in which pigeons actually do nest in apartment walls. It's a crazy alternate reality that I so desperately want to be true, and \"In the Ridge\" makes it so for a beautiful two and a half minutes. The song opens with a 5 (and a half) year old's rendition of the song, which he renders as <em>\"whoopee cushion, whoopee cushion, tooshie tooshie, tooshie tooshie, whoopee cushion, whoopee cushion, whoopee cushion, whoopee cushion, whoopee cushion, whoopee cushion.\"</em> The lyrics pick up considerably in scope and depth after that, but I really like something about starting a song with a child's voice. When most artists cull vocal samples they look for snippits that can be construed as sinister, like The Books sampling a deadbeat dad ignoring his child, or Neutral Milk Hotel sampling a kid putting down punk music, but here the sample reminds me that sound is sound. A beautiful song is essentially the same thing as a whoopie cushion, and it's useful to be reminded of that. It's also nice to hear it from a 5 year old and not John Cage. \"In the Ridge\" is a Wernquest composition, and alternates between two main chords for the entire song. Yet somehow, the vocals are layered over this sparse accompaniment to give the impression of fullness, completeness, and near-perfection. Wernquest's restraint on the guitar is commendable, and his style of playing is just casual enough to be truly endearing. The recording itself is part of the magic, done live on a TEAC 1/4\" reel to reel in a single 12 hour marathon session that went well into the morning hours, during which Heringer and Wernquest recorded all 9 of the songs that appear on their album. Wernquest explained to me that this was the first time he's ever made music with someone and had no idea what it was supposed to sound like. There was no formula for <strong>Hank and Pigeon</strong>, no musical template. In fact, they never really had any intentions of forming a proper band. It just happened, and the result is something so natural that it's almost impossible to hear without feeling some deep and abiding attachment to the music. As a lyricist, Wernquest is among the best we've featured on Ampeater. His words read like a pastiche of modern literary greats, mixed with the surreal experience of living with 8.5 million other New Yorkers. Take a look:\r\n\r\n<em>Woke up this morning\r\nSky was falling\r\nWalls were cracking\r\nTumbling down\r\nWas startled by the sound</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Crack in the window\r\nHit my pillow\r\nWhile red rain was\r\nPourin down\r\nMy brain spilled on the ground</em>\r\n\r\n<em>I heard a moon man\r\nBrushing his hand\r\nOn the glass and\r\nPlaster cracked\r\nWas flat on my back\r\n\r\n</em><em>Now I'm a pigeon\r\nAnd I'm living\r\nIn the ridge\r\nBetween the walls\r\nHoping the plaster falls.</em>\r\n\r\nIn so much as the main figure in the song actually transforms into a pigeon, it's hard not to recall <em>The Metamorphoses</em>, and the general expression of Kafka's utterly disorienting and yet somehow comforting prose style. It's magical realism at its finest, and it recalls the aforementioned liminal space (in this case, literally as well as figuratively, given that the pigeon is trapped inside the wall) between an objective reality and the one that exists in the songs of <strong>Hank and Pigeon</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"Feathers and Fur\"</strong> is a showcase for <strong>Heringer's</strong> extraordinary voice. There's something about it that immediately dispells any thoughts of \"girl with a ukulele\" syndrome, an oft lamented part of any open mic performance. Heringer is above all else highly trained, and her emphasis on precision separates her from the masses of songwriters that have also chosen this particular instrumental combination. I'm most struck by her control of each vocal phrase, as she ever so slightly tapers the closing note without sacrificing sound quality or pitch. If there's any effort required to produce such a natural tone, it's almost impossible to hear it in Heringer's performance. The tune opens with a ukulele, cycling through a chord progression that's so far off the beaten path it needs snowshoes. And yet, it benefits from the same simplicity that makes \"In the Ridge\" truly memorable. As a listener I'm swept along by the inconstant motion of the song, like an old music box playing some long lost waltz subject to oddly timed variations in tempo as its rusty cogs struggle to keep pace. It's a song that belongs to the night--both written and recorded after midnight, and it has a patience and calmness that reminds me why it's worth staying up until the day's frantic movements have faded away. The relative quiet of the early morning hours really does work wonders.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to determine at times whether <strong>Pigeon</strong> is being used as a pseudonym for <strong>Wernquest</strong> or perhaps refers to an actual bird. The wonderfully playful line <em>\"Don't break your clavicle crushing acorns in the park.\"</em> suggests the latter, while <em>\"Pigeon if you'll be my muse then I will be the best friend a boy could ever hope to never see\" </em>(a terrific line, by the way)Â provides equally compelling evidence for the former. Moreover, <strong>Heringer</strong> directly references <strong>\"In the Ridge\"</strong> in the song's last line: <em>\"And the walls are slowly caving in.\"</em> The pigeon is ultimately untouchable, a dream pigeon that exists only in the mythology of <strong>Hank and Pigeon</strong>, and any reference to it duly functions as a placeholder for Wernquest as a person. There aren't many bands that have successfully developed such a complex set of allusions on their first album, and I doubt there are <em>any</em> bands that have done so without conscientiously setting out to do so. But Hank and Pigeon evolved as the natural outgrowth of two creative spirits interacting through their art. It's not at allÂ contrived; this is about as real as it gets. Even on my most jaded days, when the monotony of existing's worn a hole in the fabric of my imagination, Hank and Pigeon somehow remind me that I can still daydream, that I can still imagine a world in which pigeons burst through walls, or in which every cell phone conversation takes place on opposite street corners. So put on Hank and Pigeon, and if it strikes you just right, head downstairs, out to the corner, and give someone a call. Maybe they're closer than you think.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - In The Ridge [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM110 Hank and Pigeon/01 In The Ridge.mp3|titles=In The Ridge|artists=Hank and Pigeon]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Feathers and Fur [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM110 Hank and Pigeon/02 Feathers and Fur.mp3|titles=Feathers and Fur|artists=Hank and Pigeon]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM110 Hank and Pigeon.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Right? Suppose so. Space is a nice place for these Brits. None of their tracks can seem to stay grounded. Thereâ€™s an skyward trajectory to their instrumental stylings, an upward lift that breaks songs open from a jog to a gallop to a sprint. Combine the grand scope of prog rock, plus terse jazz nods, with the epic vistas of krautrock, and circumscribe the action inside the crisp lines of Brit pop, and you have the Window Right. They are a live bandâ€™s live band. Grinding out technically accomplished digital/analog jamouts that preserve an unleashed spontaneity alongside the precision. Though the three piece has performed with the likes of Damo Suzuki, famed Can vocalist and all around avant garde rock god of the 1970s, the Window Rightâ€™s music trends towards the ultra-contemporary. In their pulsing metric machismo, the guitar/bass/drums/laptop ensemble achieves the automaton flair of a mellower Richard D. James. The gentle valleys and peaks are even reminiscent of pre-suck Coldplay (yes, there was a time they didnâ€™t suck), though when the band dials up the intensity they match the aggressive ferocity of neukrautrock and hausrock contemporaries Dinowalrus (in the US) and Drum Eyes (in the UK). The scope of the Window Rightâ€™s music spans a vast emotional and historical divide, the sort of reach that only instrumental music, without the articulated commitment to topical ephemera, can accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe affinity between <strong>The Window Rightâ€™s </strong>approach and some of the classic Krautrock has spawned an ongoing collaboration with Damo Suzuki. The three members of The Window Right<strong> </strong>- <strong>Matt, Neil, and Smudge </strong>- bring a new school element of laptop sampling and electric beats to the old â€œmeat and potatoesâ€ rock ensembles of yore. When the new and old school elements meet each other halfway on the shared common ground of live improvisation the results can be pretty magical. A recent TWR/Damo gig at the Hoxton Square Bar in London was an exercise in pure spontaneity, sheer creation, a rock 'n' roll sÃ©ance. None of the songs were premeditated, preplanned; the night unfolded as an adventure of raw musical intrigue, a Lizard King odyssey importing digital elements back into the primordial analog soup of surly, sweaty invention. With such an superlative rapport, the upcoming TWR/Damo gig at the Hebden Bridge Trades Club at the end of July is not to be missed.\r\n\r\nChainsaw guitar chews through the first minute-and-a-half of the<strong> A side â€œBOW SONGâ€</strong>, a metal machine monument to sonic violence. For <strong>The Window Right</strong>, the industrial siren song acts as entrÃ©e to a more primitive landscape that relies on the textural possibilities of sound over the melodic. A warm walking bass opens up a grand vista premised on the vagaries of a spare, warbling three or four note guitar lick. Barely a lick, a skeletal apparition of a musical theme. This is music for the millennial masses, part of the wayward joint drift of the avant-garde and popular consciousness away from the ideological mainstream of modernist constructivism. A Beatles/Stockhausen presentation of a Can/Reich production of a Neu/Glass film. The Window Right chases after the profane peculiarities of transcendence in songs that wrinkle and flex between opposed poles of ectoplasmic desire and astroliminal logorrhea: grade-A existential jabberwocky. The song opens up with a light touch reminiscent of a new age minimalism, but the percussion bites down hard, the sting and moan of the electric guitar radiates a feverish intensity that militates against the too easy mystico-spiritual solutions of the unicorn-and-seashell elite. In the contrapuntal variations of light and dark you can hear the Â bloodbath of the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, the total annihilation that sucked the air out of Western civilization for a generation, the lingering embarrassment of rehabilitation, the survivorâ€™s guilt. â€œBOW SONGâ€ searches for a clarity free of remorse, but uncovers only the needling tension of an anxious soul trapped in a hall of mirrors.\r\n\r\nThe fragile pitter-patter of a bright-eyed Telecaster ushers in an air of sobriety on the <strong>B side â€œGREENDIVIDEDBBLUEâ€</strong>. Gone are the Sisyphean gesticulations of â€œBOW SONGâ€. In their stead a palpable calm overtakes the music, as slow and gentle as an advancing cloud. The guitar notes pass crisply and clearly; the hi hat rings clean; the bass leads you by the hand. The overall approach is so well calibrated that you hardly register the quickening pace, the rush of the cymbals, the measured ecstasy of the slide to double time right before the three minute mark. As if a wind picked up; as if a jet pulled off the tarmac; as if a wild horse had jumped the fence, headed at breakneck pace into the highlands, the sinews straining with mad grace, becoming a blur, a speck on the horizon, then lost into the free nothing. <strong>The Window Rightâ€™s</strong> B side is an acceleration into empty freedom, free of pain and devoid of hope.\r\n\r\nA new EP and a new album are in the works for <strong>The Window Right</strong>. The trio are feverishly recording material now, esconced snugly in their studio above a London carwash. Hours and hours of live jams are being put down in search of that magical moment. The method speaks to the Window Rightâ€™s commitment to the live sound, the limitless challenge of capturing the uncapturable, sustained by the enduring belief, which all musicians share (except DEVO), that music is a moving image of eternity. A hearkening to the immutable gyrations of the celestial spheres. A six-stringed paean to the gods supported by beer, perspiration, and the white noise hum of a warm amp. More gigs are on the horizon for The Window Right, around the UK and on an upcoming Scandinavian tour, so look them up before the album comes out because nothing replaces the experience of live music.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mike Gutierrez</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - BOW SONG [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM111 The Window Right/01 BOW SONG.mp3|titles=BOW SONG|artists=The Window Right]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - GREENDIVIDEDBYBLUE [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM111 The Window Right/02 GREENDIVIDEDBYBLUE.mp3|titles=GREENDIVIDEDBYBLUE|artists=The Window Right]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM111 The Window Right.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

O'Brien</strong> will probably draw a lot of comparisons to another well-known singer-songwriter named Conor (doesn't hurt that he looks a bit like him too), but where Oberst's music, at least in its prime, was all about catharsis and abandon and wild generalizations and accusations that feel really good to yell (no matter how uncool or over-the-top or not-really-true they may be), O'Brien's is oblique and careful. Subtle, even. His lyrics slip easily from first to second to third person, and even the first person songs seem somehow distanced, easier to hear as a narrative device than a soul-bearing, this-is-the-deeply-buried-truth-about-Conor-J-O'Brien kind of thing. In fact, O'Brien is more interested in the elusive nature of truth than in any grandiose, whitewashed statements. In the quiet, brooding, sleigh-bell touched â€œThe Meaning of the Ritualâ€ (the gorgeous, delicate home-made animation for which (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOvGeo-MNts&amp;feature=player_embedded\">link</a>) is 100% worth your time and happens to be one of the only videos I've ever seen that made a song clearer and more powerful instead of just distracting me from it), he sings: <em>my love is selfish and I bet yours is too /</em> <em>what is this peculiar word called 'truth'. </em>And again, in Ampeater <strong>A-side â€œBecoming A Jackalâ€</strong>: <em>before you take this song as truth / you should wonder what I'm taking from you.</em> This fixation on the mutability of things dominates O'Brien's lyrics, and actually makes him more of an inverse-Oberst. Rather than shouting the capital-letter Truth, he's exploring the multitude of truths. <em>The songs are quite decisive, but I have no idea what I am doing, or where I am going, </em>he says in his absurdist press bio, and though some of it may be a faux-naÃ¯f pose (<em>Once the songs took shape, I asked some friends of mine to help me play them to people. When they kindly agreed, I decided that we would present ourselves as â€˜Villagersâ€™ â€“ I donâ€™t really know why.)</em>, as contrived as any other publicity stance (PR is inescapably fake; even directness becomes a mediated game of authenticity), it's still rather refreshing to hear someone say that songs should always be treated with humor, no matter the subject matter, or that his goal in songwriting is to surprise himself. Right on, Conor.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements in <strong>Villagers</strong>' songs are equally subtle and delicate, choosing the intimate gesture over the grand flourish so as to keep the dramatic element of the music subdued. <strong>O'Brien's</strong> voice burns with a gentle heat, and you're more likely to encounter gentle piano-guitar or guitar-bass unisons than washes of strings or booming brass (though there are touches of strings and french horn on other tracks of <strong>Becoming A Jackal</strong>, the band's Domino LP).Â  O'Brien has a knack for writing songs that would be perfectly solid acoustic troubadour pieces and then adding just one more section that manages to bring out the the shape of the whole song the way ice brings scars to the surface of your skin.\r\n\r\nOn <strong>â€œBecoming a Jackalâ€</strong>, a rolling 6/4 tune that manages to seem circular and winding in form without really departing much from convention, this takes the form of the section that begins <em>when I got older. </em>It's a section that manages to advance both the musical tension of the song and the narrative arc of the lyrics all at once. Finally we get the harmony vocals the song has been hinting at the whole time (with the doubling of key lines like that first <em>always rearranged;</em> the fact that the chorus is sung, doubled, at different places in the stereo spectrum from the verses; and the one tantalizing harmonized line in the second chorus).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the story leaps forward. All along the narrator has been daydreaming at the window, both cared for and imprisoned by the song's <em>you</em>, who in turn is abused by the jackals. Here he finally escapes into the streets, literally following his dream, and learns<em> a new way to move</em> from those jackals. The meaning of the song is elusive, as it should be, but it seems to have at its core a paradox: the need to betray something (alternatively: someone) you once loved in order to grow. It could be anything from rebelling against your parents to â€œselling outâ€ as a musician, though in this case the next set of lyrics, set against a series of rhythm section breaks that make them stand out like nothing else in the song, implies the latter. O'Brien <em>is</em> literally selling us his fears in the form of songs, but the fact that he knows this and does it anyway gives the line an inverted meaning: releasing songs about how untrustworthy songs are is an act that has to mean he has weighed it out and decided that there is still something important and meaningful that can be conveyed in a song. Once again: right on.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œTwenty Seven Strangersâ€</strong> is more oblique yet, a story of taking a city bus home that simultaneously begs and shrugs off interpretations, but seems to revolve around the anonymity and confusion and powerlessness of city life (anytime anyone sings the phrase <em>fluorescent light</em> you can bet this is what they're getting at: nothing says urban dehumanization like fluorescent lights). The musical accompaniment is sparse, resigned and melancholy in a lovely way, just like riding home with exhausted commuters in the lighted rectangle of the evening bus. Throughout, reverby wordless vocal melodies, fingerpicked acoustic guitar and minimal drums provide the backdrop for <strong>O'Brien's</strong> precise and even lead vocals. Not one thing changes musically in the song until 2:19, when that moment of liftoff arrives (an arranging trick that forces you to really focus on the lyrics up to that point, and also reflects the endless repetition hinted at in those lyrics), just as it does in <strong>â€œBecoming a Jackalâ€</strong>. The harmony vocals and bass finally arrive to fill out the song for the last few lines before a new wordless vocal-piano melody arrives, rising through the crashing cymbals on the first three notes as if it might transcend the song, but then sinking back down in beat-down resignation.\r\n\r\nThe very end of <strong>â€œTwenty Seven Strangersâ€</strong> is in fact my favorite moment in the entire 7â€. The original melody reappears twice. The first time it's suspended over the full band and drenched in reverb just as it was at the songs start. The second repeat is pared down to just <strong>O'Brien's</strong> voice and guitar, the same two instruments with which the song began, only this time his voice is up close, stripped of the distancing effects that hid its texture and flaws. We listen to his voice hold the final, gentle falsetto note and then crackle and sputter out like a guttering candle, the sound of the anonymous soul stepping off that city bus.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Becoming a Jackal [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM112 Villagers/01 Becoming a Jackal.mp3|titles=Becoming a Jackal|artists=Villagers]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Twenty Seven Strangers [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM112 Villagers/02 Twenty Seven Strangers.mp3|titles=Twenty Seven Strangers|artists=Villagers]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM112 Villagers.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

But when I came across their press kit in the Ampeater submissions box, I was immediately struck by their response to the question, â€œ<em>describe your music....</em>â€Â  While most bands take this prompt as an opportunity to explain just why exactly they're so fucking awesome, We Can't Enjoy Ourselves launches into a scathing and borderline-nonsensical self-critique.Â  â€œ<em>One should be careful not to expect much from (our music)</em>â€explains vocalist/guitarist <strong>Giovanni Saldarriaga</strong>.Â  It's <em>â€œdelightfully unimportant, in poor taste, demonstrably demonic, satanically pointless and thus,â€</em> he concludes, <em>â€œabsolutely fatal to art history majors, compost or compote enthusiasts, and class-conscious bores.â€</em> I suppose one should expect a reasonable degree of self-deprecation from a band named <strong>We Can't Enjoy Ourselves</strong>, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to what Saldarriaga was saying than the mere sum of the words coming out of his mouth.Â  Was it modesty?Â  Irony?Â  A desperate plea for attention?Â  Crossing off theory after theory, I finally arrived at one that seemed a bit closer to the truthâ€”poetry.Â  PerhapsÂ  Saldarriaga will cringe at this conclusion.Â  â€œ<em>You've got it all wrong</em>,â€ he'll retort, â€œ<em>it's satanically pointless!</em>â€Â  But there's a world of difference between <em>â€œsatanically pointlessâ€</em> and <em>â€œpointlessâ€</em> and my verdict holds.Â  Some might call this distinction merely rhetorical but the implications are actually quite vast.Â  I wouldn't waste my time with pointless music but satanically pointless music is another matter altogether.\r\n\r\nI agree wholeheartedly with <strong>Saldarriaga</strong> that <strong>We Can't Enjoy Ourselves</strong> is satanically pointless.Â  And what's so captivating about the satanically pointless? Â  How is it poetic?Â  I'm not drawing comparison to the poetry of Neruda or Rilke or Pushkin or anybody so serious.Â  We Can't Enjoy Ourselves approach their craft more like Velimir Khlebnikov, Lewis Carrol, or even Dr. Seuss.Â  They're of a breed of artist that, while lambasting the medium in which they work, never cease for a moment to delight the senses.Â  â€œ<em>(Our music is) inspired by Buddy Holly's music, the Brandenburg Concertos and cat food commercials from the nineteen nineties</em>,â€ Saldarriaga continues. â€œ<em>Sometimes it'll send you into orbit, sometimes Miami Beach circa 1948, a very tame year for bikinis and bathing trunks.</em>â€Â  Or, to put it a different way, â€œ<em>if you keep asking us these ridiculous questions, we're going to keep giving you ridiculous answers.</em>â€\r\n\r\nIn addition to <strong>Saldarriga</strong>, the trio features <strong>Caley Monahon-Ward</strong> on drums and <strong>Michael Leviton</strong> on bassâ€”at least that's the standard lineup, but the band of multi-instrumentalists mixes it up whenever appropriate with the addition of keyboards, harmonicas, whatever...Â  Front-man Saldarriaga has spent the last several years playing clarinet and guitar in hot-jazz ensembles.Â  Monahon-Ward drums for a number of New York area bands including <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem006\">Extra Life</a>. Leviton is an established singer and songwriter who, incidentally, toured with They Might Be Giants in 2006.Â  Â  To paraphrase, each member of the trio is a veteran performer.Â  Perhaps that's why they approach <strong>We Can't Enjoy Ourselves</strong> as a side project, a diversion from more serious pursuits (â€œ<em>we got together over the winter to record... only after realizing we all have mothers named Olga,</em>â€ explains Saldarriaga), even though the music is sufficiently potent to warrant more attention.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œCharming Manâ€</strong> springs into action with a sparse but energetic beat in which the power of the floor tom is tempered by the playfulness of a tambourine.Â  Enter jangly guitar and bass followed quickly by vocals.Â  <strong>Saldarriaga</strong>'s accent and hyper-melodic vocal hooks bring to mind Belle &amp; Sebastian and yes, if you insist, cat food commercials, but the final product is somewhat more manly than the former and considerably less obnoxious than the latter.Â  The song escalates at a perfect pace.Â  Guitar and drums launch it into a double-time feel at the first chorus and the delightfully indulgent harmonies which kick in at the onset of the second verse up the ante once more.Â  Falsetto counterpoint throughout the third verse, a maneuver that strongly evokes the Beach Boys, and a mildly spastic guitar riff in the final chorus carry the song to a euphoric end.\r\n\r\nClocking in at over five minutes long, <strong>B-side</strong> <strong>â€œLiza (They Don't Call This Dancing)â€</strong> lacks the radio-friendly brevity of <strong>â€œCharming Manâ€</strong> but the payoff is huge when you arrive at the dance-off outro about which Saldarriaga remarks, <em>â€œI thought really sold it as a plausible Motown number.â€</em> I'm not sure if I'd call it Motown but an irresistible shuffle pulse and buoyant vocals certainly make for an explosive finale.Â  Not that the beginning of the song is lacking in hooks; employing many of their usual tricks (lush harmonies, copious tambourine, and a vocal line that dives from high to low but remains sufficiently simple that somebody listening for the first time could probably sing along), <strong>We Can't Enjoy Ourselves </strong>offer the listener another pop masterpiece, one that's less conventional than â€œCharming Manâ€ but equally addictive\r\n\r\n<strong>We Can't Enjoy Ourselves</strong>' debut mini-album <strong>One Belongs Here More Than You</strong> was the the serendipitous fruit of a blizzard last February.Â  <em>â€œFor two days,â€</em> recalls <strong>Saldarriaga</strong>, <em>â€œwe laid up in the dilapidated sacristy of St. Cecilia's convent in Greenpoint where the pew fell apart on touch and where the janitor reported to us that he played the original Toxic Avenger from the eponymous film series.â€</em> With the exception of a few vocal overdubs, all seven tracks were recorded live, an impressive feat for a band that's yet to play a gig.Â  In between takes, <strong>Monahon-Ward</strong> filled the role of sound engineer and producer while <strong>Leviton</strong> corrected papers on photosynthesis and Saldarriaga studied Russian.Â  A productive way to spend two days snowed in, no?Â It's one of the best self-production jobs I've heard.Â  But as I keep reiterating, these guys know exactly what they're doing at every turn along the way.Â  And maybe that's why they can't take themselves seriously.Â  They've seen every trick in the pop-music book and consequently recognize them for what they areâ€”tricks.Â  <em>â€œThe coronary thrombosis behind Liza,â€</em> analyzes Saldarriaga <em>â€œis a little more far out than the insouciant pleading behind Charming Man.â€</em> I couldn't have put it better.Â  Knowing the formula to pump out hit after hit is a valuable skill indeed and one that few bands have acquired... but I suppose it could take a little bit of the fun out of the songwriting process.Â  Oh well.Â  If they can't enjoy themselves, at least others will.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Charming Man [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM113 We Cant Enjoy Ourselves/01 Charming Man.mp3|titles=Charming Man|artists=We Can't Enjoy Ourselves]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Liza (They Don't Call This Dancing) [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM113 We Cant Enjoy Ourselves/02 Liza.mp3|titles=Liza (They Dont Call This Dancing)|artists=We Can't Enjoy Ourselves]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM113 We Cant Enjoy Ourselves.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Blissed Out\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Blissed-Out.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" />There's a moment-a bunch of moments, actually-in Jay-Zâ€™s 2009 monster-jam â€œEmpire State of Mindâ€ where, hidden underneath the real-estate shout outs and bends-inducing compression like a C-section scar on a TV actress, you can pick out something wrong, jarring, fucked-up. Tune in at around 21 seconds and you can hear it: this high-pitched clip, like a CD skipping or a steak knife striking a glass table. Itâ€™s a strange little imperfection to find in a more or less immaculately constructed pop song, something ostensibly unrelated to musicianship or writing, but still too much <em>there</em> to be considered an oversight. Every ten seconds or so it pops up out of nowhere, grinding at the gears of the chorus, tearing the whole jam apart from the inside out like an armful of bot fly babies.\r\n\r\nI bring this up not only because <strong>Blissed Out</strong>, an NYC-based duo specializing in all kinds of trunk-rattling audio detritus, have a genius edit of this track, but because that millisecond-long mistake in â€œEmpireâ€ and the massive circuit-bent mixology this group throw down flow from the same old-school source. Rap is quite a bit different today than it was a decade ago, sure, but where most heads like to whine about the lyrical transition from the socially-conscious to the fiscally-conservative, itâ€™s also important to note how that thematic shift has been mirrored in the genreâ€™s musical methodology. Sampling, record scratching, the infinite repetition of a breakbeat were all transcendent sonic malfunctions, punk gestures stemming from the same kind of technological anti-humanism as playing slide guitar with a lead pipe or cutting up your torso with a bunch of broken beer bottles thrown hatefully at the stage. Synth-crazed Mannie Fresh-ness, on the other hand, no matter how great it might sound vibrating the tinted windows of your Escalade, doesnâ€™t inspire fear of a black planet, just envy of a black AmEx. Which is why, when Hovaâ€™s biggest hit in years comes accidentally equipped with incessant, intrusive noisiness, we not only get a throwback to the auto-destructing golden years of rap, but an exciting insight into how this sort of musical antagonism could pop a hole in hip-hopâ€™s fat-suit. This is where Blissed Out really come into the picture, taking that phantom peak off â€œEmpireâ€ and spinning it not only into a single remix, but an entire projectâ€™s worth of deeply damaged low end theory. If these guys were somehow selected to produce Jiggaâ€™s next album, it would be released on Deaf Jam, and instead of being Black, it would be the kinds of colors you see when someone punches you really hard in the face.\r\n\r\nâ€œ<em>Both hip hop and noise involve re-appropriating instruments and technology, removing them from their intended contexts and creating something new with that,</em>â€ says Alex, one half of the group, on <strong>Blissed Outâ€™s</strong> conceptual heritage. â€œ<em>There also is a physical connection between hip hop and harsh noise. That is, a physical feeling one gets when listening to it, created by the frequencies. With hip hop, this is found in the extreme low tones used and with noise the extreme highs that are often found.</em>â€ Itâ€™s usually bad news when rock writers conflate signature sonics with biographyâ€”Ray Charlesâ€™ ivory style mimicking a heroin score, Justin Beiberâ€™s pedophile-baiting croon being anything more than an accident of prepubescence, and so onâ€”but this dichotomy of found sound and physical pain, a devastating low to a redemptive, ear-cleansing high, seems distinctly related to the bandâ€™s formation. When asked about it, Alex says, obliquely, â€œ<em>I almost died. But a little less than 2 years before that, I met Sasha...</em>â€ Sasha being dude number two in BO. Long story short, Alex got sick for an entire year, underwent surgery, confined himself to his apartment and rediscovered an old sampler he had bought when he was younger. A series of early morning electro workouts followed, these one-man-jam seshes culminating in an extended improvised sound check with Sasha one evening in 2009 at a house show in Bed Stuy. Like Gillespie meeting Parker, or Cash joining Carter, it was pure Bliss.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s rare to find a band with this refined an aesthetic, let alone one thatâ€™s been playing together for less than a year. Falling somewhere between Merzbow-ian tape-fuckery, the distorted narco-haze of 90s shoegaze, 808s and heart disease, <strong>Blissed Out</strong> manage to condense and amplify the elemental nightmare of new-century pop musicâ€”that itâ€™s made by machines, that it has no soulâ€”into something that makes assimilation into SkyNet not seem like such a terrible idea after all. Plenty of people are pushing electronica in emotive, wonky directions, but where the vibe of something like Disaro and witch house is spooky in an anachronistic wayâ€”old, creaky houses and super-8 filmâ€”Blissed Out excels in thoroughly modern modes of terror, the sound of your brain cells turning into numbers, the rape-breathing of a thousand sentient samplers, the holographic image of Peter Brotzman conducting a full-blown army of pixelated machine guns.\r\n\r\nThe two tracks posted here come off the groupâ€™s <em>White Triangle</em> cassette, recorded live at Silent Barn and released by Mirror Universe Tapes in June. <strong>A-sideÂ â€œ+Empire State of Mind Edit+â€</strong> we mentioned before, and <strong>B-side â€œ+Tropical Fantasy+â€</strong> retains a similar payload of skittering, underwater beatwork wrapped inside a variegated caul of bit-crushed dub. The song titles all have pluses at either end, kind of like a battery with only positive ends.\r\n\r\nKeeping in tune with that hopeful tip, Alex concludes, â€œ<em>I get the most inspired to create by listening to hot 97, reading art and fashion magazines,Â late night walks around the city, and the people that are around us. Even before recordingÂ music for </em><strong><em>Blissed Out</em></strong><em>, I had fallen into something where I kept meeting people, then, following that, discovering they were creating music. Seeing all of these kids around me doing it made me realize that creating music wasnâ€™t an unattainable goal.</em>â€ Alicia Keyes, dodging the demon clip, playing the worldâ€™s loudest piano, said it herself: <em>thereâ€™s nothing you canâ€™t do</em>.

src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Bunnys-a-Swine.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"453\" height=\"604\" /><em>\"Our sound has been called tweegrunge by some, awkpop by ourselves, and indie rock by others,\"</em> explained guitarist/vocalist/keyboardist <strong>Candace Clement</strong> when asked to describe <strong>Bunny's a Swine. </strong>While the distinction may be largely semantic, I concur with Clement that awkpop is the most suitable and certainly the most telling classification for this unconventional trio from North Hampton, MA.Â  Those other labels might still apply, but they fail to capture the essence of Bunny's a Swine.Â  What separates these guys from other indie rockers out there is that they're so fucking awkward.Â  It hit me the first time I heard <strong>A-side \"I Should Have Left the Bushes Hours Ago\"</strong> and numerous spins later, I still can't get over it.Â  Even if you haven't heard the music, take one look at the press photo accompanying this review and you'll probably be nodding enthusiastically in agreement.Â  What could be more awkward than some scruffy hipsters standing in front of a faux-dramatic nautical backdrop striking convoluted poses?Â  Even the name \"Bunny's a Swine\" seems pretty awkward.Â  I asked the band for the story behind it and their answer only confirmed my suspicions.Â  <em>\"We really liked referring to things using 'bunny's a...',\" </em>they explained, <em>\"like 'bunny's a tour' or 'bunny's a show' or 'bunny's a swingle,' a reference to a 3 song single CD we made for a weekend tour in Vermont.Â  Its really infectious after a while.\" </em>Major-league awkward.\r\n\r\nBut in case you haven't noticed, awkward is the new cool.Â  Many musicians nowadays subscribe to the outcast mantra, embracing the embarrassing traits for which they might have gotten their asses kicked and their milk money stolen in elementary school and recasting them as quirky or charming.Â  <strong>Bunny's a Swine </strong>simply pushes that mantra to its limits and, I should add, succeeds gloriously in doing so.Â  The untempered awkwardness is irresistible.Â  I adored Bunny's a Swine after hearing just a few notes.Â  I don't mean strictly that I adored the music.Â  More precisely, I adored the lovely people behind the music and was struck by an unshakable urge to give each of them a big hug.\r\n\r\nIn addition to <strong>Clement</strong>, <strong>Bunny's a Swine </strong>features <strong>Dustin Ashley Cote</strong> on drums and <strong>Emerson Stevens</strong> on 3-string guitar.Â  The latter instrument is another good indication of just how awkward this band really is.Â  Perhaps you haven't heard of the 3-string guitar but one needn't think too hard to imagine the conditions under which this unusual instrument might have been born.Â  The inability to string a guitar, the failure to master anything beyond power chords, and a lack of money to purchase new strings were the primary hypotheses to jump to my mind.Â  As it turns out, there's a little truth in all of them.Â  Stevens found his first guitar in a dumpster and never bothered to restring it.Â  <em>\"My interest never was in being a great guitarist,\" </em>he clarifies.Â  <em>\"I wanted to write songs and found that pounding out bar chords on some piece of junk with 3 strings was more than enough to do that.\" </em> But even Clement, the de-facto virtuoso of the group, plays nothing so technically demanding that somebody who has played guitar for only six months wouldn't be able to master it.Â  <em>\"Much of what we do derives from our beginnings as a band,\" </em>explains Cote.Â  <em>\"We started out as a two piece, Emerson and I, neither of us really knowing how to play.\" </em>Bunny's a Swine rejects virtuosity in favor of simple might.Â  The lo-fidelity recording techniques employed by the band accentuate this decision, creating the sensation that the music never left the attic in which it was born.\r\n\r\nAmong the many awkward traits that make <strong>Bunny's a Swine </strong>so damn endearing is unabashed sloppiness.Â  The creative process is pretty transparent.Â  Most of the songs originate with Stevens but when he brings them to rehearsal, everybody sings whatever they feel like singing until, eventually, something interesting emerges.Â  Clement explains, <em>\"most of the time we have no idea what the others are singing about until months after we've finished the song.\" </em> A band with multiple lead vocalists who pay little heed to one another will inevitably devolve into chaos.Â  Bunny's a Swine simply harnesses this chaos and transforms it into an exhilarating tension.Â  Distinct vocal melodies pile sloppily together, vying for the listeners attention, and then converging in brief flashes of harmony.Â  To catch the words is nearly impossible.Â  As soon as you hone in on one lyrical thread, another will butt in over it. Â  And yet, miraculously, Clement observes, \"<em>the meanings almost always sync up.Â  Bushes is a great example.Â  It wasn't until we recorded that track that we knew both people were singing about very similar themes of voyeurism.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThe song Clement refers to is <strong>â€œI Should Have Left the Bushes Hours Agoâ€</strong> Beginning with calm and luxuriously paced instrumental introduction, it kicks into second gear when the whole band starts to sing and shout simultaneously. Â A punchy melody delivered in sloppy unison by an out-of-tune baritone and screechy tenor is tempered by a delicate and melodic soprano line. Select words cut through the mix but are quickly drowned out, evoking the atmosphere of a crowded house partyâ€”incidentally, the kind of event at which Iâ€™d most like to see this band performâ€”in which only fragments of conversation manage to rise above the roar of the room. The music gradually escalates in speed and volume until the climatic moment when vocal melodies finally intersect.Â  <em>â€œPlease do not turn out your inside light,â€</em> the band shouts in harmony.Â  This flash of clarity packs a strong punch after such a long buildup.Â  <strong>B-side \"Fuck Bunny's a Swine\" </strong>employs many of the same techniques but is notably more schizophrenic in form.Â  Beginning with a steady instrumental dirge to back <strong>Stevensâ€™</strong> deep and unrefined voice that at times channels Johnny Cash, the song unexpectedly jumps into to a doubletime punk feel about halfway through before finally returning to a tranquil refrain with harmonies reminiscent of The Carter Family. Â  Not that such references were premeditated.Â  I get the impression that Bunnyâ€™s a Swine was simply having a good time.Â  The common thread linking these sections is a raw energy so earnest it could not have been forced.\r\n\r\nAfter commending <strong>Bunnyâ€™s a Swine</strong> on its sloppiness, awkwardness, lack of instrumental prowess, and other traits not generally deemed praiseworthy, I feel compelled to stress that my appreciation is not in any way ironic.Â  I admit to enjoying certain bands because they're so bad they're good but Bunny's a Swine really isn't one of those bands.Â  Only when you strip away technical virtuosity and fancy production does it become clear what a band is really madeÂ of.Â  Occasionally you'll find a band that has a heart beneath the superficial gloss but more often, virtuosity and production mask a disappointing inner void. Â So many bands lack genuine substance, which is precisely what makes Bunny's a Swine so refreshing and, probably, so awkward.Â  Sincerity can be embarrassing.Â  Ever wonder why rock stars never smile?Â  Bunnyâ€™s a Swine is a labor of love.Â  Wait, scratch that!Â  Was labor really involved?Â  This band doesnâ€™t practice, it plays, and the joy of playing shines through every noteâ€”wait, scratch that!Â  The joy of playing simply shines because without the gloss, there's nothing to stand in its way.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - I Should Have Left the Bushes Hours Ago [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM115 Bunnys a Swine/01 I Should Have Left the Bushes Hours Ago.mp3|titles=I Should Have Left the Bushes Hours Ago|artists=Bunnys a Swine]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Fuck Bunny's a Swine [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM115 Bunnys a Swine/02 Fuck Bunnys a Swine.mp3|titles=Fuck Bunnys a Swine|artists=Bunnys a Swine]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM115 Bunnys a Swine.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

To the extent that a musical exchange can be scripted, these are, with the most notable example being that of the \"virtuoso duel,\" in which Fleck's pitted against a fellow musician in an epic bluegrass shred battle. This alone would be enough to capture the interest of most audience members, and is the point at which I usually start checking Twitter on my phone, but he usually adds in a cute little twist to boot--the challenger is presented as a college educated, formally trained product of the system, while Fleck boasts a mere high school diploma to his name (nevermind that it was from a prestigious performing arts school). Inevitably, Fleck defeats his nemesis, demonstrating the superiority of good old fashioned street smarts and personal discovery over the rigid discipline of the conservatory method. While Bela Fleck's not exactly your average front porch banjoist, his broad point is a decent one--education is no substitute for true vision and creative inspiration. <strong>Keith Hampson</strong> dropped out of high school when he was 16, and soon every class on his imaginary schedule read \"music.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Power Animal</strong> emerged from the ashes of <strong>Hampson's</strong> failed attempt at normalcy, and like some real life rehash of Fight Club, I imagine him stepping into the cave of his own muse and finding comfort there. Throughout our exchanges, Hampson dropped subtle and no doubt unintentional hints that he's not exactly swiming with the main stream. Days went by between e-mails, followed by an apologetic note to the tune of,  <em>\"Sorry I kinda had to 'half-ass' the bio. I don't have much computer time.\"</em> Given that I receive 15 e-mails a day from douchy Australian teen-rock bands with a $10k publicity budget and 4 music videos for their only song, it's refreshing and ever so slightly jarring to hear from someone who exists mostly in the pre-digital era. Moreover, he makes a point of noting that every current member of Power Animal (all eight of 'em) is from Northeast Philly, an area of the city supposedly bereft of musical culture, thus making Power Animal an odd singularity of its kind. Unlike Brooklynites who might drop out of CUNY to absorb the rich music scene around them, sensing tangibly that \"something's happening\" and wanting to be a part of it, Hampson's withdrawl is to a self contained space in which ideas and isolation fuse to form something original, emotive, and enormously enjoyable. Fans of compositionally obtuse musical collectives with a thorough grounding in pop (Broken Social Scene, Akron/Family and <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem021\" target=\"_blank\">Cuddle Magic</a> all come to mind) will dig this 7-inch.\r\n\r\nI know summer's winding to a close, but if there's room on your iPods for just one more vacation mega-jam, let aptly titled <strong>A-side \"Summer Came From Nowhere\"</strong> be it. With a simple repeating melody, floating synth lines, and a breakdown tag complete with distorted cheers, this song's become my charm against the impending winter months. <strong>Power Animal</strong> shuns any traditional notion of instrumentation for an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach that toys with cacophony but never goes so far as to loose its hard-earned momentum. The group's eight members are encouraged to play \"<em>every suitable instrument they [can] get their hands on other than guitar,\"</em> and if possible, all at once. Clocking in at under three minutes, \"Summer Came From Nowhere\" is almost a prelude, an in-your-face introduction that boldly stakes claim to the musical territory it inhabits. Taking a page from 80s pop, new wave, and even prog rock, it so thoroughly overwhelms the senses that the transition into <strong>B-side \"The Turn Around\"</strong> is an almost welcome reprieve.\r\n\r\nWe're ushered into the song by children singing, <em>\"Hello, buddy just turn around\"</em> and then dropped into what I'd imagine a Books / Sufjan Stevens collaboration might sound like, but with more intensity than either of these two artists could ever put down on wax. The similarities between <strong>\"The Turn Around\"</strong> and the musical style regularly employed by The Books go well beyond critical comparison or mere homage--there are some direct quotes and rhythmic motifs that have been lifted almost unchanged from the original tracks. But far from being reprehensible, it's intriguing to see an artist sport influences so recent and give them a sense of urgency and vibrance unheard on the original recording. Beck lifted the strings on Serge Gainsbourg's \"Melody Nelson\" for his album Sea Change, not because he didn't think anyone would notice, but because he had something to contribute to Gainsbourg's musical sentiments, and the most efficient way of accomplishing this is to take the idea, quote it, and expand upon it. So too is the case with \"The Turn Around\" and its Books samples or Sufjan Stevens horn melodies. Like everything else Hampson writes, it's the collective effect of these voices, coupled with some little man sitting on his shoulder shouting <em>\"GO!!! GO!!! GO!!! GO!!! GO!!! GO!!!\"</em> that makes the resulting pastiche a substantively new experience.\r\n\r\nWhile nowhere near as epically famous as they deserve to be, <strong>Power Animal</strong> pulled off a successful U.S. tour this past Spring, and has a brand new record under their belt.

So, prepare for a lot of food analogies. I'll save the tie-tying analogy for next week.\r\n\r\nWriting pop songs is a lot like baking desserts (bear with me). A novice would assume that the thing to do is to go heavy on the sugar and just make the damn thing as sweet as humanly possible. I mean, that's what people go to desserts for, right? Sweetness and excess. However, an expert knows that the touch of salt or mint or basil is what makes for a truly superlative pastry experience. To really appreciate the sweetness of a dish, one needs a hint of something savory and unexpected. The same goes for pop music. Yes, of course, you can't have a pop song without hooks, just the way you can't make dessert without something sweet. But great pop songs are always garnished with just enough spice to keep you coming back over and over again. (Two examples off the top of my head: 1. The way the melody in Phosphorescent's â€œPictures of Our Torn Up Praiseâ€ pulls back so hard against the tempo that it almost doesn't keep up with the chord changes. 2. The way Van Morrison sings the entirety of â€œWho Was That Masked Man?â€ in falsetto.) Large doses of refined and unmodulated white sugar are what get you factory pop music, and if that's your bag, you are probably not here on this website reading this essay.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't know if Boston indie pop quartet <strong>Hands and Knees</strong> can bake a cake (for some reason I want to say no, but there's no relevant information in their bio. I'll have to tell them to update it), but I do know that they can write a bouncy power pop song that doesn't cloy even after you've listened to it about 20 times in a row. Their Ampeater <strong>A-side â€œDancing On Your Tearsâ€</strong> is a perfect example, building catchy pop music out of unusual six and nine bar phrases, which phrases consist of brief guitar stabs, counterweight bass syncopation, playful drum fills, and the slurred twin vocals of <strong>Carina Kelly</strong> &amp; <strong>Joe O'Brien</strong> (when they've been in a band long enough, two people can adopt the exact same vocal ticks to the point where they can double vocal lines that seem undoubleable). Some pop songs are weighed down by their artistic ambitions, but here the two are perfectly in sync. <strong>â€œDancingâ€</strong> bounds and cascades along with so much enthusiasm precisely because it's so formally off-kilter. The six bar verse phrase always ends just before you expect it to, crashing headlong into the beginning of the next phrase before you even know what's happening. Then, in the chorus, the elongation of the lyrics <em>bread and butter</em> (buh-huh-ter) during the break stalls the bands re-entry just enough to make you feel like the rug's been pulled out from under you, only to fly back into another rambunctious verse. Even the simplest part of the song, the lyric-less bridge, runs out two bars earlier than you'd expect, only multiplying the momentum. All this form-play might sound complicated, but the song leaps along with the boundless energy of a new puppy, and you'd never notice a thing unusual about it until you'd already heard it countless times.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œThe Moonlight Is Wickedâ€</strong> is simpler formal fare for the most part, but devastatingly catchy and dotted with major two and three chords that spice up the tonality nicely. It also features some lovely jangle-twang lead guitar over the tagged ends of the choruses and the couplet <em>you like simple fun / I like depression</em>, the brilliance of which speaks for itself. The rolling rim-click percussion in the verses lets the song breathe and hang back until the repeated, saucy <em>you'</em>s bring it to a boil and shove us on into the blissful chorus. It's a song that's full of indie pop touchstones: the duel boy-girl vocals, the guitar hook answering the chorus melody, the silly humor of the verse lyrics. Even the verse progression is tried and true. If I wanted to bust out a second totally unnecessary culinary analogy, I'd liken a song like <strong>â€œMoonlightâ€ </strong>to a perfect pasta sauce. It's nothing you've never seen before, yet when it's put together with enough time and care, it can be the most satisfying meal you ever ate. Seriously, be careful with this one, folks. Once you pipe it into your head, it will not want to leave.\r\n\r\nBoth of these jams come courtesy of <strong>Hands and Knees'</strong> new, as-yet-untitled full length, generously made available by the band for free perusal on their <a href=\"http://handsandknees.bandcamp.com\">Bandcamp page</a>. The whole record is full of gangly energy, popping snare drums and tasty guitar hooks. But not only that. Something about the album makes you feel like you are listening to your friend's band, if they suddenly got their shit together and started writing really great songs. <strong>Hands and Knees</strong> call themselves <em>unfussy</em>, and it's true. There's something selfless and eager about these songs. They want to tag along and make your walk to work a little easier. They want to give you something to whistle while you're making coffee. There's no frills and no needless obscurity, just fantastic pop music with a dash of the unexpected. Heat and serve.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Dancing On Your Tears [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM117 Hands and Knees/01 Dancing On Your Tears.mp3|titles=Dancing On Your Tears|artists=Hands and Knees]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - The Moonlight Is Wicked [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM117 Hands and Knees/02 The Moonlight Is Wicked.mp3|titles=The Moonlight Is Wicked|artists=Hands and Knees]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM117 Hands and Knees.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Cupcakes</strong>, the term <em>minimalist</em> has been applied with greater frequency than perhaps any other.Â  Iâ€™ve encountered it in reviews by several prominent publications and blogs, as well as in an array of press releases and publicity materials.Â  Even <strong>Hank</strong> and <strong>Cupcakes </strong>themselves have embraced the term.Â  â€œ<em>If I had to define it, Iâ€™d call the music experimental minimalist pop,â€</em> explains Hank.Â  And so, given what the whole world seems to think, Iâ€™m probably going to raise a few eyebrows by admitting what Iâ€™m about to admitâ€”I just donâ€™t see it.Â  Although I love what Hank &amp; Cupcakes are doingâ€”<strong>A-side â€œAinâ€™t No Loveâ€</strong> has tallied up enough spins on my computer in the past month alone to merit a tenured position on my top twenty-five iTunes playlistâ€”<em>minimalist</em> is among the last words that I would use to describe it.Â  Terms such as <em>high-energy</em>, <em>strong</em>, <em>seductive</em>, and <em>funky </em>would be more appropriate, and on the spectrum between <em>minimalist</em> and <em>over-the-top</em>, it lies considerably closer to the latter end.\r\n\r\nOf course, Iâ€™m prepared to offer ample justification for my contrarian beliefs.Â  I suspect that most critics are trying to emphasize that <strong>Hank &amp; Cupcakes</strong> is a two-piece band.Â  <strong>Hank</strong> plays bass while <strong>Cupcakes </strong>sings and beats on the drums.Â  The ingredients, admittedly, are low in quantity, but theyâ€™re deceptively potent.Â  Hank gets more <em>oomph </em>out of his instrument than just about any other bassist out there, amply filling the void left by the absence of guitar.Â  His technical ability and sense of groove are undeniable and his mastery of effectsâ€”an unfathomably complicated chain of wahs, flangers, and loopers that I couldnâ€™t begin to describeâ€”allows him to transform the bass from a chiefly rhythm-instrument into an everything-instrument.Â  Cupcakes, for her part, lays down hard-hitting beats behind the set and dominates the mic with the soul of a blues diva and the fuck-you-suavity of a disillusioned punk rocker.Â  Put them together and you get something that sounds suspiciously like a full-fledged rock band trapped in the body of an incredibly talented duoâ€”not exactly what I imagine when I hear the term <em>minimalist</em>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hank</strong> and <strong>Cupcakes</strong> are the <em>noms de plume</em> of <strong>Ariel Scherbacovsky</strong> and <strong>Sagit Shir</strong>.Â  The pair began making music together in their hometown of Tel Aviv and took their act to New York City a little over a year ago.Â  Since then theyâ€™ve generated a lot of hype, as one critic phrased it, <em>â€œsucking in a whole class of the most dour and sophisticated hipsters, forgetting the trends and coolness and making them dance.â€</em> Thereâ€™s an undeniable chemistry between the pair, which probablyâ€”okay, definitelyâ€”has something to do with the fact that theyâ€™re a married couple.Â  <em>â€œSince weâ€™re a couple, our love and musical communication gives the music a sense of urgency when we play live,â€ </em>Cupcakes explains. â€œ<em>We create something new every time we play and invite the audience to take part in the process.</em>â€Â  Whether itâ€™s urgency, intimacy, or something else entirely, couple-bands invariably project a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> that can be highly alluring.Â  It worked for The White Stripes, it worked for Matt &amp; Kim, and itâ€™s working for Hank &amp; Cupcakes, which has the potential to become every bit as successful.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œAinâ€™t No Loveâ€</strong> has enough hooks to become a Top-40 radio hit, enough groove to keep the crowd moving at the discothÃ¨que, and enough personality to merit respect from the most pretentious of listeners.Â  Cupcakesâ€™ edgy vocals bring to mind Karen O of Yeah Yeah Yeahs, while the music is more reminiscent of Sly &amp; The Family Stone or Blood Sugar Sex Magic-era Red Hot Chili Peppers.Â  Structurally and lyrically simple, the song exudes an infectious and upbeat energy that persists even through breakdowns.Â  <strong>B-side â€œSheâ€™s Lost Controlâ€ </strong>explores much darker themes without sacrificing an ounce of intensity.Â  Covering the iconic Joy Division but staying true to its own style, <strong>Hank &amp; Cupcakes</strong> breathes new life into the song.Â  The lyrics â€œ<em>sheâ€™s lost control</em>â€ seem self-referential when delivered by Cupcakes, producing an unsettling intimacy that no male singer could replicate, accentuated by Hankâ€™s ominous low groove and eerie melodies. The song punches into second gear when the beat drops with discomforting robotic precisionâ€”as if control really has been forfeitedâ€”and builds steadily toward a climax in which the earlier melodic themes return and spiral together as the beat dissipates in a flurry of cymbals.\r\n\r\nBoth <strong>A-side â€œAinâ€™t No Loveâ€</strong> and <strong>B-side â€œSheâ€™s Lost Controlâ€</strong> come from <strong>Hank &amp; Cupcakes</strong>â€™ self-titled EP, but to fully comprehend the groupâ€™s appeal, youâ€™ll need to experience the spectacle of its live performance.Â  Bands with lead-vocalist drummers are rare, due to both the technical difficulty of singing while beating out complicated rhythms and the challenge of exuding a vibrant stage presence from the confines of the drum throne.Â  <strong>Cupcakes</strong> surmounts these challenges by standing behindâ€”or even atopâ€”the kit and allowing the rhythmic intensity of her drumming to permeate throughout her body, manifesting itself in dance that seems to drive rather than hinder her punchy delivery on vocals.Â  <strong>Hank</strong> takes care of the rest, covering so much territory that one critic observed <em>â€œfans may find themselves scrutinizing the stage, looking in vain for the guitar player that seems to be filling out the band's sound.â€</em> The couple also projects undeniable sex appeal.Â  Admittedly, the relationship between sex and music has been complicated by the rise of MTV, with many lamenting a shift in emphasis from good music to good looks.Â  Nevertheless, music and sexuality have always shared an inexplicable linkâ€”a link that Hank &amp; Cupcakes artfully draws upon.Â  Cupcakesâ€™ sultry voice and Hankâ€™s bottom-heavy grooves exude a sexual energy from which their music derives much of its vitality.Â  This vitality is precisely what gets the crowd moving and keeps them listening with rapt attention.Â  Rather than serving as a distraction from the music, sex appeal (exaggerated lipstick, short skirts and high heels) actually serves to accentuate the power and message of the music.Â  Check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SvDC_i4ivw\" target=\"_blank\">this clip</a> of Hank &amp; Cupcakesâ€™ televised performance on Fearless Music and youâ€™ll understand. Or, better yet, go and see them live.Â  Hank &amp; Cupcakes is currently on tour, stopping off in Boston, Philadelphia, and various upstate NY locations before returning to the big apple in late September.Â  For a full concert schedule, check out their Â <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/hankandcupcakes\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace profile</a>.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom:40px\"><strong>7-inch removed at artist's request</strong></div>\r\n</div>",

Â  Audiophiles may cringe at the dead snare tone and muddy low end but DIY enthusiasts will applaud the intimacy of this homely aesthetic.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/59235120-1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" style=\"width:200px\" />In addition to <strong>Bechle</strong> on vocals, guitar, and (occasionally) keyboard or trumpet, <strong>Shiv Hurrah</strong> features <strong>Daniel Benjamin</strong> on drums, <strong>Alex Drum</strong> on guitar, <strong>Carl Robinson </strong>on guitar, and <strong>Sean McCausland</strong> on bass.Â  The Brooklyn-based ensemble, which has frequently been compared to the likes of Wilco and Morning Benders,has been at it for less than a year under the current formation.Â  However, all except Robinson played together in Rochester, NY a decade ago.Â  They moved to Boston in 2001 where they met their fifth member, but things quickly disintegrated and it wasnâ€™t until they found themselves in New York this past year that the band was reborn under the name Shiv Hurrah.Â  Theyâ€™ve recorded a 5-track EP thus far, from which both cuts on this Ampeater Digital 7-inch are drawn.Â  Iâ€™ve included the album art (the original work of bassist McCausland) here, simply because I love itand because if I hadnâ€™t been intrigued enough to click on it, I might never have heard of Shiv Hurrah in the first place.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-side â€œOh Oh Ohâ€</strong> is the last track on the EP and it ends things in grand style.Â  The strongest hookâ€”the title lyricâ€”is melodic ear-candy delivered in captivating ghostlike falsettos that the lack of â€œreal wordsâ€ accentuates.Â  There are only about five chords in the entire song but theyâ€™re astonishingly well used.Â  A two chord hook gives way to a verse with a bit more harmonic motion before settling on the minor for the chorus.Â  As noted, the vocals are low in the mixâ€”a stylistic choice that I supportâ€”buried under a thick background (erâ€¦ foreground?) consisting of guitar, drum, bass, keyboard, and brass section (trumpet and trombone).Â  However, itâ€™s nice when harmonies kick in to help the vocals stand out at key moments.Â  If you listen carefully, youâ€™ll find a few lyrical gems, my favorite being the delightful paraprosdokian, â€œ<em>I never get homesick, I just get sick of my home.</em>â€Â  <strong>B-side â€œHeart of Leadâ€</strong> shares some of the same great qualitiesâ€”simple yet powerful chord progressions and memorable melodies that tug at the heartstringsÂ  A nice addition is the synthesized bassline which seems straight out of the 80â€™sâ€”the vocal refrain adds to this effectâ€”but which blends surprisingly well with the indie production and vibe.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked <strong>Bechle</strong> why heâ€™d selected these particular tracks, a question I ask the majority bands that I review, I received one of the most concise and telling answers Iâ€™ve ever heard.Â  Â  â€œ<em>If my house was on fire,â€ </em>he explained, â€œ<em>but I only had enough time to save two songs, these would be the ones</em>.â€Â  Itâ€™s telling because there is indeed something unquestionably dear about these bittersweet and highly evocative songs. Â  When I listen to <strong>Shiv Hurrah</strong>, a number of incredibly visceral feelings bubble up, and I find myself sorting through memoriesâ€”both real and imaginedâ€”in search of their source.Â  Iâ€™ve said it once and Iâ€™ll say it againâ€”the music inspires a deep nostalgia for an adolescence unlike the one I actually lived. Â  Admittedly, the idea that one may feel nostalgic for something imaginary seems rather suspect but thatâ€™s precisely the kind of nostalgia that Shiv Hurrah somehow conjures for me.Â  How?Â  I believe that nostalgia is caused not by recollection of the lovers weâ€™ve lost or by the â€œgolden daysâ€ weâ€™ll never relive but by recollection of the emotions that they once provoked.Â  It occurs when those emotions hit us with an urgency and vividness weâ€™ve long forgotten.Â  What caused them in the first place isnâ€™t so important.Â  How exactly does this relate to music?Â  Allow me to digress briefly by drawing upon an analogy from the art world.Â  Realism gave way to Impressionism and eventually to surrealist and abstract modes of representation because many artists found themselves better able to express emotion in less formally restrictive styles.Â  Thereâ€™s a big difference between technical honesty (when everything appears exactly as it really appears) and emotional honesty (when everything feels exactly as it really feels).Â  Shiv Hurrahâ€™s music falls into the latter category, cutting straight to the heart by conveying emotion at the expense of particulars which may or may not be broadly applicable.Â  The listener can fill in the blanks for himself, with personally relevant imagery inspired by the powerful dose of unadulterated sensation.Â  Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s not my first kiss that I recallâ€”a meaningless affair with a girl I hardly knew and which ended as abruptly as it had begun when our front teeth awkwardly collidedâ€”but the imagined first kiss, the paralyzing radiance of her soft lips, two souls uniting, caution giving way to confidence as my pounding heart confirmed that this is the moment my whole life has been leading towards.Â  Of course, it didnâ€™t work out that way, but my thirteen-year-old self certainly devoted enough thought to the fantasy, and the force with which I yearned for it was as real as anything Iâ€™ve ever felt.Â  I never forgot the fantasy per se, but Iâ€™ve long recognized it for cheesy, and consequently had viscerally forgotten the potent sensations it once provoked until the music of Shiv Hurrah conjured the same angsty yearning and a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu sent my mind drifting.\r\n\r\n<strong>Shiv Hurrah</strong> probably wonâ€™t help you recall an imaginary first kiss, but Iâ€™m willing to bet it will evoke something impressive.Â  Listen and enjoy!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Oh Oh Oh [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM119 Shiv Hurrah/01 Oh Oh Oh.mp3|titles=Oh Oh Oh|artists=Shiv Hurrah]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Heart of Lead [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM119 Shiv Hurrah/02 Heart of Lead.mp3|titles=Heart of Lead|artists=Shiv Hurrah]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM119 Shiv Hurrah.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Wicked Yawnz\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Wicked-Yawnz-300x288.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"288\" />Once-time contributor to slop-folk megagroup the Earth People Orchestra and current member of the \"never-famous dirt-heavy bacon-pop tri-force\" Beach Hair, DIY savant <strong>Joseph Kelly</strong> has bequeathed unto us an audio journal for the ages. Assembled from influences as diverse as top 40 R&amp;B and Tupac Shakur, <strong>Wicked Yawnz</strong> is the audio journal of someone so capable at expressing his thoughts in music that these pindrop samples of his personal catharsis reach heights seldom achieved by most artists' formal recorded output. Kelly describes the process as a \"punk band diary,\" set down in proverbial stone through a series of spontaneous moments, spurred on by dreams, lovers, alcohol, a nice walk, or an old 45. Each song's odd instrumentation is virtually always aÂ  product of availability, but whether he's setting beats on a casio keyboard or strumming on an old acoustic, Kelly has a remarkable knack for capturing and conveying genuine experiences in their purest form and planting the seeds of his own memories in listeners. Fans of Jeff Mangum and Graham Smith will be all over this.\r\n\r\nMost people who keep journals or diaries combine pure factual reporting with a fair bit of editorializing on their experiences. <strong>Kelly's</strong> musical entries are no less complex. He composes songs both about what he's seen or done, but also what he's thought he's seen or done, which in the song world translates to something infinitely more interesting than <em>\"I totally saw Mitch with Jackie today\" (fact) \"and Jackie's hair looked like shit so I totally think Mitch is into me\" (opinion).</em> Though \"composed\" spontaneously, Kelly's lyrics flow naturally with the force of experience to push them over the cusp into sound. He's not shooting for perfection, just expression. There is nothing, and I mean nothing, available on <strong>Wicked Yawnz</strong> in the greater blogosphere, and I get the sense that these songs were never strictly intended for a public audience. From the moment one sits down to write a memoir it's with the intention that it should eventually be read; diaries not so much, and \"punk band diaries\", definitely not so much. Every time I hear another <em>\"Live and Unplugged\"</em> album from an established artist, I feel like I'm listening to memoirs on tape. The intro to some much beloved song kicks in and all I hear is, <em>\"Though it's commonly thought that I cheated on my wife while she was dying of cancer, I really didn't, so there. Can we give it a fucking rest now?\"</em> Memoirs suck, musical or otherwise. But reading someone else's journal is an exhilarating experience in uncensored voyeurism. You're always waiting to see whether you'll make an appearance, and if so, whether the diarist's perception of your person or actions match whatever broad self-expectations you've built up. Of course, few of us are likely to make an explicit appearance in Kelly's musical journal, but I nevertheless sympathize with people and situations in his songs in a way that strikes me as peculiarly personal.\r\n\r\nIn his own words, both songs on this 7-inch are <em>\"about the same person first off and both kind of have this sense of I'm sorry I fucked up, but also a bit of humor and some well fuck it. I don't care. Too late anyways. I guess.\"</em> <strong>A-side \"Baby I was a Bad Friend (Love You)\"</strong> is a self-deprecating second-person account of a broken relationship, wrought with intersecting feelings of love, attachment, hatred, regret, and self-affirmation. Acoustic guitar piped in at the wrong (or just the right?) level lends a consistent drone to <strong>Kelly's</strong> strumming. Somewhere in the background a snare stumbles along, and Kelly's endearingly abrasive voice plainly describes the state of a failed union over an increasing veil of fuzz. Like a Pollard demo tape, it's the musical clarity that carries through above all else, and the rough-around-the-edges aesthetic that surrounds it only enforces its authenticity as a personal document, that we as listeners should feel privileged to hear it. When it occurred to me, this thought somehow substantiated my already budding suspicions that these are fundamentally archival documents. <em>N.B.: Music nerds respond to the word \"archival\" like club girls respond to V.I.P. It's the de facto signifier of quality that lets us know, \"Even if this sounds like shit, listen to it because it's worthwhile.\" Not that Wicked Yawnz sounds entirely like shit, but ya know, it's totally worthwhile.</em>\r\n\r\nOne caveat of the spontaneous song is that the harmonic structure needs to be kept relatively simple in order for the artist in question to make it through the damn thing. This is made up for by complexities of texture, and little imperfections that mix things up enough to remedy any repetitious elements. Plus, repetition can be comforting. There's an element of drone to everything <strong>Kelly</strong> does on this 7-inch, and it creates an almost meditative backdrop to the narrative of his lyrical journal. Take for example <strong>B-side \"This Ain't No Free Style...\"</strong> The song's dead simple: a clap beat on 1, 2+, and 3+, a three note continuo that makes g G D seem somehow as important as the bassline to \"Moonlight Sonata\", and a treble line that runs the scale with slow deliberation. But there are glitches, subtle ones, that disturb this little trio. The whole song distorts every 12 seconds or so, just enough to prevent someone listening from ever truly settling into the superficial monotony of it all. The tune never wholly disintegrates, and these momentary lapses become part of the repetition--a fourth element to the now familiar trio. Then, as the song winds to a close, it comes apart. Variations in tempo, short skips, and a new electric piano arpeggio pull whatever stitches were holding it all together, and the song spirals into a short bout of dissonance before the track ends with an abrupt cut. It's a dramatic finish to the song and a suiting close to a musical journal entry that finds our hero Joseph Kelly feeling pissed off that his girlfriend constantly compares him to her ex, who was apparently adept at beatboxing, freestyling, and fucking shit up. The song opens with a line from Kelly, then moves on to a kind of question and answer format between Kelly and his girlfriend (who's incidentally also the subject of <strong>\"Baby I Was A Bad Friend (Love You)\"</strong>, with a kind of Greek Chorus commenting on Kelly's lack of mad skillz.\r\n\r\n<em>Kelly: I wrote down a rap song, but I can't rap very well.\r\nGirl: Do you know how to beat box?\r\nKelly: I can't be box very well.\r\nChorus: Ain't no Rahzel,\r\nKelly: Or whatever that guy's name is.\r\nGirl: Do you know how to freestyle?\r\nKelly: Can't freestyle very well,\r\nChorus: Ain't no Rahzel,\r\nKelly: Or whatever that guy's name is.\r\nGirl: Careful where you aim that spray can,\r\nGirl: People be judging that shit, man.\r\nKelly: Ain't your ex-boyfriend,\r\nKelly: Whatever that guy's name was.\r\nKelly: And I don't plan to paint the town,\r\nKelly: Just my neighborhood, for now.\r\nKelly: Ain't very good,\r\nKelly: I'm trying.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's a common message to both songs on this 7-inch--sure there's anger, sadness, and loss, but there's also a real sense of hope. As abused as he feels, <strong>Kelly's</strong> essential human impulse is to make the situation better. <em>\"I'm trying,\"</em> he says in the last line of <strong>\"This Ain't No Free Style...\"</strong>.Â  This is somehow what makes him such a personable character in the musical telling of his own trials and troubles. There's no narcssism, no blind self-assertion or genuine hatred. Just a handful of pity mixed with an extraordinary ability to convey genuine and simultaneous feelings of love and lossÂ  about a single subject. Why he ever thought to share a gift so intensely personal with the world is a glorious mystery, but after having spent several weeks with the 7-inch, I'm itching to hear the record, read the novel, and watch the film of <strong>Wicked Yawnz</strong>. Give these tunes a listen, I mean a real close listen, and I guarantee you'll feel the same way.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Baby I Was a Bad Friend (Love You) [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM120 Wicked Yawnz/01 Baby I Was a Bad Friend.mp3|titles=Baby I Was a Bad Friend (Love You)|artists=BWicked Yawnz]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - This Ain't No Free Style...

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Darlingside\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/image_2702090_highres-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" />Five beautiful voices backed by three guitars and the conventional bass and drums.  Backed somewhat less-conventionally by violin, cello, and mandolin.  Further supported by the thoroughly obscure pennywhistle and saz.  Five guys.  Five unique musical personas.  One aesthetic, astonishingly more congruent than the sum of its parts.\r\n\r\nIâ€™m talking about <strong>Darlingside</strong>, a self-dubbed â€œstring rockâ€ outfit based out of Northampton, MA.  String rock is an apt term since, for a band with three guitarists, guitar plays a surprisingly minimal role in Darlingside's sound, taking a backseat to rich string arrangements.  Bass too keeps mostly clear of the limelight, with low frequencies dominated by cello.  Vocals also dominate, often in the form of lush five-part harmonies, and drums are the final major ingredient in the Darlingside aesthetic, commanding in both volume and intensity and perpetually diverging from the expected course.  The songwriting carefully balances satisfying refrains with a penchant for exploration and, while somewhat heavy handed, is refreshingly self assured in that.   Although theyâ€™ve been together for only a year, theyâ€™ve broken out of their hometownâ€™s venerable but student-centric music scene and have the toured east coast heavily, from Portland, ME to D.C.\r\n\r\nThe band chalks its eclectic sound up to an â€œunlikely hodge-podgeâ€ of musical backgrounds, which merits some explanation.  <strong>Harris Paseltiner</strong> (cello, guitar) is an accomplished classical cellist who has appeared twice on NPR.  <strong>Auyon Mukharji </strong>(violin, mandolin, saz) traveled to Brazil, Ireland, and Turkey, on an ethnomusicology fellowship, studying and writing about the traditional music he encountered there.  <strong>Don Mitchell</strong> (guitar) toured throughout the states as a boy alto and, after picking up guitar, honed his singer/songwriter talents playing for sunset boat cruises in Maine.  <strong>Dave Senft</strong> (bass, guitar) started arranging vocal music in college as musical director of his a cappella group after which he spent two years as a street musician.  <strong>Sam Kapala</strong> (drums, pennywhistle) began drumming at the age of seven, and his background includes ample training in jazz, funk, hip-hop, and rock.  On top of it all, theyâ€™re all talented vocalists.  In fact, the band met in college while singing together in an a cappella group.  Listen carefully and you'll probably hear all of these influences at play, although they blend together naturally enough that it's easy to forget how unconventional the mix is.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-Side â€œMaleaâ€</strong> is the most anomalous and probably the most captivating cut on Darlingsideâ€™s debut EP.  The band explains that it was originally conceived as contemporary dance piece, which is easy enough to imagine given the strong hip-hop groove, a surprising ingredient amidst the band's usual blend of rock, pop, and bluegrass.   <strong>Kapalaâ€™s</strong> drumming marks this unexpected yet satisfying addition most notably.  The spastic dance-club breakbeat he conjures behind the set completely recontextualizes the rootsy and somewhat sinister string groove.  The rhythmic hand-clap breakdown during the first chorus is another key instance in which this acoustic ensemble draws upon electronic influences.  Granted, this sort of syncopated clapping descends most directly from flamenco, where it is commonly used to accentuate impassioned vocal crescendos and polyrhythmic guitar strumming, but in context, the effect resembles more closely a remixed Justin Timberlake club hit than anything off a CamarÃ³n de la Isla album.  <strong>Senftâ€™s </strong>punchy vocals undeniably have a lot to do with that.  His spot on falsetto leaps are soulful ear candy and the way his voice skips on the word <em>â€œtry-y-y-yâ€ </em>screams sampled.\r\n\r\nBut <strong>Darlingside</strong> doesnâ€™t use samplers or drum machines. These guys often forgo evenÂ electric guitars, opting for an unplugged aesthetic.  Oddly enough, you'll find few instances of acoustic musicians incorporating electronic influences into their style but the reverse is longstanding tradition.  Many pioneers of electronic music opted, either by popular demand or a lack of imagination, to adopt acoustic conventions of composition and arrangement.  Consider, for instance, Switched on Bach, the seminal recording in which an entire orchestra was replicated on the Moog.  But how often do you see a pianist attempting to mimic a DJ scratch battle?    And yet, it seems only natural that musicians growing up in the digital age would be inspired by the popular sounds of their generation.  What then can we make of Darlingsideâ€™s use of acoustic instruments to approximate a glitch-heavy remix?  For that matter, what about the breakdown a la Rage Against the Machine in which the expected scorching electric guitar is replaced with equally scorching strings?  Listen and draw your own conclusions, but Iâ€™m enthralled.  <strong>â€œMaleaâ€</strong> bumps and rips as much as the sources from which it draws inspiration, but is warmed by a touch of earthiness.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-Side â€œGood Manâ€</strong> is a well-crafted pop song tinged with a dose of folk.  Itâ€™s not so experimental as <strong>â€œMaleaâ€</strong> but it better represents <strong>Darlingside's</strong> signature rootsy aesthetic.  The strings at the beginning make for an alluring intro, evoking a touch of bluegrass until a stadium rock drum beat cuts through the mix with unexpected but pleasing force.  However, vocals quickly dominate.  Darlingsideâ€™s spot on five-part harmonies carry the tune, giving the refrain much of its punch.  The bridge provides a nice interlude and allows the lush instrumentals to swell briefly to the front of the mix, but itâ€™s primary function seems to be to set up the epic final chorus which Darlingside delivers in good form.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œGood Manâ€</strong> showcases <strong>Darlingsideâ€™s</strong> vocal talent better than perhaps any other recording on the EP.  Listen and it will become abundantly clear that not only can everybody in the band sing, they can all sing incredibly well.  I wonder whether some readers may feel, however, that they even sing a little too well.  In particular, lead vocalist <strong>Senft</strong> has a voice worth millions, but this may be perceived as both a blessing and a curse.  On one hand, a voice like his seems destined for heavy radio play and sold-out stadiums around the world.  On the other hand, it may not be so palatable to indie taste buds.  Most indie singers have voices that, at least classically, would be considered less than ideal.  The genre prizes those who turn lemons into lemonade, bound by vocal limitations to forge their own unique styles.  This naturally leads to a bias against vocalists appealing too strongly to the mainstream.  I mention this to urge you, should nauseating comparisons to Jason Mraz or John Mayer be difficult to suppress, not to dismiss Darlingside and keep your biases in check.  Focus on how the band utilizes its vocal power and I expect youâ€™ll agree that theyâ€™re considerably more versatile and dynamic than any of the pop rock stars youâ€™ve categorically disowned.\r\n\r\n<strong>Darlingsideâ€™s</strong> sound doesnâ€™t fit cleanly (or even approximately) into any of the numerous hip subgenres in vogue today.  It's also not the kind of music to be dissected and deified by the avant-garde, for although it's got plenty to enjoy, it's not bizarre, challenging, or ironic enough to warrant such attention.  However, it's still a bit too quirky to be lapped up mindlessly by the undeserving mainstream.  One might wonder then where Darlingside, alienated from both extremes, will find its most ardent support.\r\n\r\nA fair concern, and yet, I canâ€™t shake the feeling that this music has widespread appeal.  Itâ€™s music that my hip college sister, jazz aficionado father, and eccentric grandmother who only generally only listens to the Beatles, childrenâ€™s songs, and feminist spoken word poetry, would probably all enjoy.   And itâ€™s music I enjoy.  Pop sensibilities unconstrained by the pop aesthetic push <strong>Darlingside</strong> outside the realm of trendy, safely beyond the obnoxious trifling of those who wear their music tastes on their sleeves as a mere fashion accessory, and into deeper and more enduring places.\r\n\r\nPurchase the full EP at <a href=\"http://www.darlingside.com/shop\" target=\"_blank\">www.darlingside.com/shop</a> or check out their show tomorrow (the 10th) at <a href=\"http://www.crashmansion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crash Mansion</a>!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Malea [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM121 Darlingside/01 Malea.mp3|titles=Malea|artists=Darlingside]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Good Man [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM121 Darlingside/02 Good Man.mp3|titles=Good Man|artists=Darlingside]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM121 Darlingside.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

It's almost as if the same gene that makes someone a creative individual is the one that prevents them from grasping what exactly about their creations can be appreciated by others. The real reason, I suspect, is that most music somehow obscures its own meaning, or makes the work of interpretation essential to fully experiencing its essence. Of course, this view presupposes the idea of a song as a thing in itself, a coherent and observable entity with a single objective manifestation. One might think of a song in the same way one conceives of a table--not as some vague notion of what it means to be a \"table,\" but rather accepting as given that the \"table\" exists, and that it serves a certain function defined within reasonable constraints. In some ways, \"song\" certainly fits this description, and gives me a controlled set of assumptions as to what I might expect, especially when compared with a symphony, cantata, piece, abstract, composition, or god forbid sound experiment. But on the other hand, the notion of \"song\" can be more akin to \"love\" than \"table.\" Despite the last millenia's attempt to define and categorize \"love\" (courtly love, romantic love, filial love, etc.), it's hard to say exactly what it is, how it's supposed to affect us, or how we're supposed to affect it. The full experience of a song is the act of switching between these two sets of expectations, between the objective and the deeply and personally subjective. Pop songs err on the side of \"table\", while art songs err on the side of \"love,\" but the best of each embrace both concepts equally. Good listeners are musical metaphysicians of sorts, able to decipher both strains simultaneously, all the while taking in a song's musical content. It's a process akin to unwinding strings of DNA like the zipper on your windbreaker, reading the code buried within, and emerging with a composite image of the song as both object and experience.\r\n\r\nIt's rare to meet a musician (not someone who plays an intrument well, but a truly creative individual) who is able to articulate this aspect of his or her own music. The greatest minds in songwriting have absolutely no filter--Bob Dylan, Bob Pollard, and Paul McCartney all come to mind. Some weeks back, <strong>Barrett Lindgren</strong> wrote me an e-mail about his home recording project <strong>Ghost/Light</strong>, and I was immediately struck by how fully he grasps the rich complexities of his own musical endeavors. LindgrenÂ explained, <em>\"I wanted to make a record about the feeling of transience and intensity that many people my age have. When you leave home, everything feels very new and daunting. You are still learning to walk on your own feet and figure out who you are without parents, siblings, friends, and familiar surroundings. That can be very scary for a young person. Right after I left home, my best friend was killed in a bike accident a few days before his 18th birthday. It seemed like my whole life started after that. Everything felt huge and powerful, and I decided to try and capture that feeling with this album. I want it to be kind of overwhelming.\"</em> Lindgren's explanation is profound in both its accuracy and insight--Ghost/Light delivers exactly as promised, with a 7-inch that to me defines the perilous grandeur of life at 20 in the 21st century as much as \"Easy Rider\" or \"On The Road\" defined their own generations. It's a feeling I remember well, and that four years later is only just fading into a kind of nihilistic disillusionment. There's a sense at 20 that you're equipped with the weapons to tackle the world, but you're a bit unsure of how to actually use them. Think pre-Yoda Luke Skywalker, and you'll get a pretty good idea of what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\nIn a CMJ season wrought with laptop backing tracks and Ableton beats, it's refreshing to hear that <strong>Barrett Lindgren</strong> doggedy sticks to the same 16 track recording process that musicians have been using since the 80s to capture their ideas on tape. There's no laptop in the signal chain, and Lindgren can't imagine there ever being one. When I asked him about the actual process of sitting down to record these tracks, he told me,<em> \"Recording the album was reallyÂ intense. I was living in a 10x10 bedroom in West Philly with all of my equipment. I was working two jobs and had to find recording time around the schedules of three bands that practiced at my house throughout the week.Â I still use the same 16 track that my friend lent me five years ago. I only have one microphone. If I want an instrument on a song, I usually just borrow it from a friend and try to learn how to play it. I set up all these boundaries to make recording a challenge so that I have to be completely aware and in control. It's kind of therapeutic and kind of masochistic. I could never switch over to Protools or Cubase. As soon as I look at a digital display I feel completely uninspired. I'm not trying to dog people who are into recording on computers, I just cannot do it. So I use outdated, broken, limited equipment, and I usually play almost everything on my albums. Music has always been an intensely personal experience for me. It's something I'd like to change, but I don't know if it will.\"</em> In a world in which the technical wizardry of recording can completely consume the music being recorded, it's utterly imperative to set boundaries, limit distractions, and to carefully construct the channel through which your songs flow onto record. In a fortunate twist, it's Lindgren's constraints upon himself that conversely result in a record that feels unreservedly open and expansive.\r\n\r\nThe last time we heard from <strong>Barrett Lindgren</strong> was as the lead man in <strong><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem005\">Amazing/Wow</a></strong> (I dig the / band name pattern), and though there's an undeniable raw energy to the group's distortion-laden rock anthems, I admit that I wasn't at all prepared for the consummate beauty of <strong>Ghost/Light</strong>. At thirteen, Lindgren had a revelation: <em>\"I started going to see these showcases of local bands called Terry's Serendipity Cafe. I found out that there were kids, just a few years older than me, making beautiful, meaningful, passionate music. I realized that just because I was thirteen, I didn't have to write pop punk songs about not wanting to go to school. I could literally do whatever I wanted.\"</em> And that is exactly what he did. When I queued up <strong>A-side \"Be Brave,\"</strong> I was, for the first time in months, completely blown away. Don't get freaked by the Israel Kamakawiwo'ole ukelele vibe at the beginning--after a slow fade and solo uke intro, Barrett's effortless lilting voice enters with the first verse of a mixed lament, later floated atop a lush swatch of uke, glockenspiel, guitar, banjo, tambourine, violin, and half a dozen other instrumental tracks. Each repetition of the chous is ushered in by a cymbal roll that lends the song a pervasive glimmer, like some lost treasure of a melody, waiting to reward someone bold enough to approach it. This sense of epic motion is further perpetuated by vocal overdubs that land square on the chorus in something akin to unison. I wonder whether the title \"Be Brave\" is directed as much towards the songwriter as it is to the lost love he addresses in the song. He's summoned up the courage to tell her to move on, and be brave in making the hard decision to choose a solitary life of happiness over the conjoined misery of their relationship; meanwhile he's convincing himself to muster his emotional reserves and be brave enough to let her go. Lindgren sings, <em>\"there is remorse and there is regret or there is happiness / and I know you've been dying to feel okay.\"</em> This is the kind of song that gets me wondering how much clothing and whiskey I can fit in a duffle bag, and how far I can get by Greyhound on $62 cash. Despite \"Be Brave\"'s ultimately positive message,<em> \"remorse\" </em>and <em>\"regret\"</em> are the words that seem to pop on the chorus, and I wonder whether the song subltly undermines its own message, suggesting that actually being brave is a harder feat than merely encouraging bravery in oneself or others.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"Tides\"</strong> is in effect the <strong>Ghost/Light </strong>anthem. The song's divided at its midpoint by a churning development section, and if it were silent film I'd imagine a text panel with the words, <em>\"Time Passes for Our Hero, Barrett\".</em> Before the break <strong>Lindgren</strong> sings over the sparse guitar accompaniment of the introduction,  <em>\"I felt small and unallowed / I wanted to make you my home / I wanted to be nowhere, surrounded by nothing / and be alone.\"</em> After the break, encouraged by a sudden eruption of percussion, he shouts <em>\"Tonight the world looks small, but open wide.\"</em> It's a full indication that he's conquered the troubles and uncertainties of the first verse, and I get the sense that he's done so fully, without remittance. There's no doubt left, no sense that he could slip back into the isolation of the  song's opening stanzas, as there is in <strong>\"Be Brave.\"</strong> Had he circled back around with a solo acoustic outro, I might have guessed at the tiniest bit of hesitance in his otherwise convincing show of lyrical and musical confidence. But he importantly forgoes this route, and instead fades to silence during the song's musical climax, giving one the impression that the triumphant march continues indefinitely, and that we're only privilieged to witness its inception.\r\n\r\nThe march does indeed continue, as <strong>Lindgren</strong> wraps up a tour as <strong>Ghost/Light</strong>. Catch him in CA and WA over the next week (details on <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/barrettlindgren\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a>).

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Dust Jacket\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Dust-Jacket-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><strong>Dust Jacket</strong> describe themselves as frenetic, lyric-centric, indie rockers with a healthy dose of shimmer and bombast.  I would add that they are bright, funny, personable, musically talented, well-read, politically knowledgeable and involved, determined, laid back, cool, kind to the elderly, patient with randoms, helpful but not patronizing to inexperienced and slightly lame reviewers, and able to accomplish complex tasks with only a magnetized guitar pick and antique maps.  Okay, I can't really attest to that last attribute; but I met up with front man <strong>Conan Zimmerman</strong> and lead guitaristÂ <strong>Shane Cook</strong> in their home base in Phoenix, Arizona and I positively affirm the rest of it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Zimmerman</strong> writes lyrics and music that juxtapose uncomplicated words and tonalities in ways that resonate and insinuate themselves into your subconscious.  <strong>Cook</strong> takes acoustic compositions and transforms them into driving rock, adding rhythms and sonic structure.  For Conan Zimmerman the process of writing requires introversion, which seems to be at variance with his role as a charismatic front man.  The contradiction provides the creative tension that makes his compositions so engaging.  Consider this quatrain from their <strong>A-Side, \"The Ballerina and the Bombardier,\"</strong> which leads off and is representative of their latest album of new material <strong>\"More Greek Myths.\"</strong>\r\n<em></em>\r\n\r\n<em>\"You are point shoes and a parasol\r\nI am an abacus and alcohol\r\nYou are amethyst made aerosol\r\nI am arithmetic and adderall\"</em>\r\n\r\nPairing <em>\"parasol\"</em> with <em>\"adderall,\"</em> even for those with attention deficit disorder, is the sort of whimsy that makes the lyrics memorable and worth listening to carefully.  Like much of the material on <strong>\"More Greek Myths,\"</strong> the song is catchy for its simple melodic theme.  It finds its way into a refrain overlaid with another refrain, like the <em>stichomythia</em> between tragic hero and Greek chorus, and finds resolution with a resounding and strident guitar verse of dominant chords.  <strong>Zimmerman</strong> and <strong>Cook</strong> are not tragic hero and Greek chorus, and they don't finish each other's sentences, but they have been playing together for more than 15 years in various guises (they were founding members of <strong>Dust Jacket</strong> 8 years ago), and they easily complement each other's musical phrasing and beats.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"More Greek Myths\"</strong> represents years of work, and the tracks are consistently engaging.  With an obvious depth of material, they could have easily chosen any of the other tracks for an A-Side. All are carefully crafted, with the sound mix achieved by bassist <strong>Dan Spohn</strong>, and final mastering done by Roger Siebel, who has worked with groups we've all heard of.  One surprise is that while the mix blends <strong>Zimmerman's</strong> voice as an instrument, none of the tracks are lyrics-forward.  The CD release includes a sheet of lyrics, but on first listen some of the vocals are difficult to discern; and that is surprising because the lyric poetry of their songs is one of <strong>Dust Jacket's</strong> major strengths.\r\nWhen albums were only released on vinyl, they often included lyrics on the cover or as an insert.  One would listen to the album several times, reading along.  I find that today I listen to downloads as single tracks, and almost never read the lyrics.  The good news is that nowadays it's easier for bands to record and distribute music.  The bad news is that we often fail to give new music a chance.  Dust Jacket benefits from repeated plays, and it would help to read along.  (If they don't jump out at you, the lyrics should be on their website by the time you read this at <a href=\"http://www.dust-jacket.com\" target=\"_blank\">dust-jacket.com</a>).  When I first heard \"More Greek Myths\" I enjoyed it, but it didn't really grab me.  After listening for awhile, and reading the lyrics, I found the songs unexpectedly going through my mind.  The arithmetic and adderall worked.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dust Jacket</strong> selected <strong>\"The Same In My Boots\" for the B Side</strong>.  It is a protest song addressing a problem with illegal immigrants -- and I don't mean undocumented workers.  The problem in Arizona is with a very specific individual who was born in Massachusetts, immigrated to Phoenix from Nevada, and failed to make any attempt to understand or assimilate into the local culture. Characterizing the entire being of an undocumented worker (who is usually Hispanic) as \"illegal\" when he's violated a bureaucratic visa requirement has a tinge of racism, but the guy I'm talking about is definitely an \"illegal\" through and through.  It cost the people paying taxes in Phoenix (many of whom are not US citizens) over $40 million to settle lawsuits against him, and he consistently violates the US constitution.\r\n\r\nHis name is Sherriff Joe Arpaio.  After the government withdrew federal funding from illegal alien Joe Arpaio, a bunch of wingnuts in the state legislature passed a law call SB1070, which required local police to enforce federal immigration laws.  The result is a racist bill that many police have denounced, and which the federal courts have (so far) deemed unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nArtists cancelled shows in Arizona as a protest against SB1070, but that was not a viable option for an unsigned band with day jobs in Phoenix.  Instead, they joined other artists on a compilation produced by The Phoenix New Times.  <strong>\"The Same In My Boots\"</strong> is compelling and fun (I was tickled to see the governor, who was recently reelected on a campaign of falsehoods and stupidity, referred to as <em>\"La Chupacabra\"</em>).  In the tradition of protest songs, it is plaintive and acoustic.  For now, the only place to hear the song is The Phoenix New Times CD and here, and we can expect to hear another recording soon that is more fleshed out musically.\r\n\r\nYou may have heard <strong>Dust Jacket</strong> at the 2008 CMJ Festival in Brooklyn.  They have played with some amazing groups in their hometown of Phoenixâ€”groups such as Vampire Weekend, Cold War Kids, Frightened Rabbit, Handsome Fursâ€”but sadly the indie music scene in Phoenix is less vibrant than one would expect of a large city.  For now, Dust Jacket plays small venues locally, and hopes to spread its recorded music nationally.  They suffered a setback when, just after finishing the new album, their drummer decided to spend two years in Italy learning to be a sommelier.  But soon after drummer <strong>Sam Valdivia</strong> came to round out the group, and the five (I think keyboardist <strong>Ari Morris</strong> is the only one I haven't mentioned yet) now label themselves as <em>\"people playing instruments like typewriters.\"</em>\r\n\r\n<em></em>I enjoyed <strong>Dust Jacket</strong> the first time I heard them.  Now after repeated listening, I enjoy the music even more.  The lyrics are a pleasure to read, giving us small unforeseen pleasures as they are accompanied by an occasional unexpected chord change or syncopation.  And the more one listens, the more one gets from the material.  If you don't already do this with new music, I urge you to try an experiment.  Listen to Dust Jacket more than once.  If you put a little work into listening to them, you'll start to get back all the work they put into making this music.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"review\">\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/tag/david-spiro\">David E.

As in many of his previous recordings, Chandler dresses depressing lyrics in ironically upbeat chord progressions, peppy rhythms, and a whole lotta ukulele.   However, Runnin' also marks a significant step forward for Chandler.  The experimental and concise songwriting featured throughout the EP demonstrates newfound artistic maturity for this bard of the \"lost generation\", as he likes to call it, and the production is considerably more polished than on his past releases.   \"The Demise of Me\" and title-track \"Runnin'\" make for the most obvious hit singles since they're so damn catchy.

We hope you'll join in, and celebrate the only Thanksgiving music worth celebrating (that is, unless you count the artist known as <a href=\"http://www.marriagerecs.com/thanksgiving\">Thanksgiving</a>, who has a reasonable claim to this title). In any case, wherever you are, eat some grub, drink some beer, and pass the fuck out. That's what we'll be doing. See you next week!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/b8DtpdXZi0M&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/b8DtpdXZi0M&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n</div>",

Particularly, the aim was to fully craft just one songâ€¦ And to post it on the internet without disclosing any information about the personnel involved. To see what the hell would happen.â€</em>\r\n\r\nThis cryptic message mysteriously found its way into the Ampeater submissions box a few weeks ago and whoever sent it delivered exactly as promised.Â  The submission form was accompanied by precisely one fully-crafted pop song (<strong>A-Side â€œSwayâ€</strong>) as well as a B-Side which in comparison seems superfluous, its primary function to fulfill the two-track requirement for an Ampeater Review.Â  Apart from a few words about each track, we didnâ€™t receive much else.Â  Conspicuously absent were the fun goodies (novella length biographies, spiffy press kits, etc) we often receive from artists itching for a write-up.Â  We didnâ€™t even receive an email address or phone number at which to press the band for more information.\r\n\r\nWhenever I hear a new band Iâ€™m struck by an unshakable urge to learn everything there is to learn about it.Â  With <strong>Chrome and the Ice Queen</strong> my efforts didnâ€™t get me very far.Â  Intrigued by the anonymity, I decided to prod my <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=%22chrome+and+the+ice+queen%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a\">most reliable friend</a> for additional info.Â  Unfortunately, even she wasnâ€™t able to assist me much.Â  I learned that Chrome and the Ice Queen is a boy/girl duo which barely qualifies as news in light of the name and general aesthetic.Â  Faces were blurred or obstructed in all the press photos I was able to uncover.Â  I discovered that the group is from Toronto and that theyâ€™ve played a few shows recently which is a decent lead but, regrettably, one Iâ€™m completely unable to follow up on since I donâ€™t live anywhere near Toronto.Â  Discouraged, I quickly abandoned the search.Â  Besides, I consoled myself, even if I could unravel their true identities it would be quite tactless for me to do so publicly when theyâ€™ve clearly gone through such pains to hide them.\r\n\r\nI thus found myself confronted by the unique challenge of writing up a band that, on paper, doesnâ€™t exist.Â  To understand the implications of this challenge, you must keep in mind that, by conservative estimations, the average music review is comprised of nearly fifty percent biographical filler.Â  Philosophical rhetoric vaguely related to the aforementioned biographical filler generally makes up another quarter and so, in the best of cases, perhaps the remaining quarter will pertain directly to the music.Â  So what was I to write about?Â  To scrap the whole review would have been the safest choice and I considered doing so for a brief moment.Â  I wouldnâ€™t even have needed to go through the awkward formality of explaining to the artist why he or she isnâ€™t the right fit for Ampeater. Â I didnâ€™t have any way to make contact.Â  Oh, it would have been so easy not to write this review!Â  Consequently, the mere fact that it exists should be taken as a powerful testament to the music.Â  The enigmatic artistâ€™s<strong> </strong>solitary pop masterpiece was so captivating that I felt compelled to press forth and Iâ€™m glad I did because eventually I discovered somethingâ€”even more alluring than a strong bio is a complete lack thereof.\r\n\r\nThe idea of forming a faceless and storyless band in an industry where image counts for so much seems, to say the least, counterproductive.Â  Granted there are a handful of bands that have managed to make a splash in spite ofâ€”perhaps as a result ofâ€”embracing what I will henceforth refer to as the <em>hidden identity gimmick</em>.Â  Gorillaz succeeded gloriously but probably couldnâ€™t have done so without the economic and promotional support of a major label and extensive industry connections.Â  The faÃ§ade didnâ€™t last long either, and Albarnâ€™s efforts to hide his identity were probably doomed to begin with.Â  How long did he seriously expect before the world noticed he sounded suspiciously like the guy from Blur and connected the dots?Â  Daft Punk also flirted with the hidden identity gimmick, revealing their names but hiding their faces behind robotic masks.Â  Incidentally, such masks proved to create a more memorable image than their faces ever could have.Â  Both examples are clearly exceptions to the rule and for a band to hide its identity is akin to playing Russian Roulette on a revolver loaded with 5 bullets.Â  In other words, itâ€™s practically suicide.Â  Does <strong>Chrome and the Ice Queen</strong> have what it takes to make it big against improbable odds?\r\n\r\nMy verdict is yesâ€”that is, provided commercial success is something they care about.Â  The litmus test is whether the impenetrable enigma of the hidden identity gimmick jives with the image evoked by the music.Â  In this case it really does.Â  Itâ€™s time check out <strong>A-Side â€œSwayâ€</strong> if you havenâ€™t already done so.Â  Itâ€™s not the sort of song youâ€™ll want to sing along with but itâ€™s a great song to get hopelessly lost in.Â  The overall effect is reminiscent of Portishead.Â  Itâ€™s dark, mysterious, and treads the improbably thin line between fiery passion and ice-cold indifference.Â  The band describes it as â€œ<em>the story of a seductive murderess</em>â€ which rings true, even if youâ€™re not paying attention to the lyrics. <strong>The Ice Queen</strong> projects the image of a bona fide femme fatal and her chillingly sexy voice and nonchalant delivery are considerably more alluring because of her inaccessibility.Â  We face a complete dearth of photos to salivate over but I suspect the vast majority of our readershipâ€”regardless of gender or sexual preferenceâ€”would like to go to bed with her.Â  No real beauty can rival imagined beauty.Â  Meanwhile, <strong>Chrome </strong>brews up a deep trip-hop groove that bathes the vocals in just the right ambiance.Â  Itâ€™s slow, sensual, and sinister.Â  The production value is spot on and unexpected horn riffs turn an otherwise bread n butter arrangement into something a bit more memorable.\r\n\r\nTo a certain degree <strong>B-Side â€œEndingsâ€</strong> is filler material but what else could one expect from an artist who has made the creation of precisely one fully crafted pop song the explicit goal?Â  <strong>Chrome and the Ice Queen</strong> enlightens us by explaining that it was created using cut-up (physically) cassette tapes.Â  As one might reasonably assume from this description, the composition sounds more like a final project for an electronic music course than anything youâ€™re apt to hear at a club or on the radio.Â  It clearly wasnâ€™t designed to be a hit but the concept is sound.Â  Tune in, especially if you enjoy ambient music.\r\n\r\nThe more I dwell on it, the more it seems likely that <strong>Chrome </strong>and <strong>The Ice Queen</strong> are established musicians playing a joke on the world.Â  Why else would they be so eager to reveal their identities?Â  Yet the possibility remains that theyâ€™re simply unknowns with an astonishing understanding of the art of suspense.Â  Regardless, I hope that the pair will be motivated by the reception of â€œ<strong>Sway</strong>â€ to release a follow-up single.Â  They certainly have the right sound and image to become a cult phenomenon with significant mainstream crossover appeal.Â  I see vast room for growth should they wish to perpetuate the hidden identity gimmick. The enigmatic personas of <strong>Chrome</strong> and <strong>The Ice Queen</strong> could be flushed out considerably and perhaps even developed into full characters.Â  Unless Iâ€™m missing the point.Â  Having fulfilled their goal of creating just one fully crafted pop song, perhaps theyâ€™ll keep quiet.Â  It all comes down to their motives, which are difficult to decipher as we know so little about them.Â  Nevertheless, I canâ€™t shake the feeling that theyâ€™re trying to tell us something through their anonymity.Â  The lesson may be that we should pay more attention to the music itself and less attention to whoeverâ€™s making it.Â  Perhaps itâ€™s better just to listen.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve been unable to contact <strong>C</strong><strong>hrome and the Ice Queen </strong>to inform them that their review has been posted but I suspect that those involved will find it and have a good laugh at us all.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Sway [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM124 Chrome and the Ice Queen/01 Sway.mp3|titles=Sway|artists=Chrome and the Ice Queen]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Endings [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM124 Chrome and the Ice Queen/02 Endings.mp3|titles=Endings|artists=Chrome and the Ice Queen]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM124 Chrome and the Ice Queen.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

What the hell does that mean? Well, aside from the obvious connections (they perform a beautiful and faithful <strong>Waterloo Sunset </strong>on their free EP <strong><a href=\"http://www.ifyoumakeit.com/album/busmans-holiday/old-friends\" target=\"_blank\">â€œOld Friendsâ€</a> </strong>and the obvious differences (no electric guitars, fewer band members), here's what that means: Busman's Holiday specialize in story songs with acrobatic, catchy melodies and witty lyrics that flesh out archetypes as deeply middle-class American as the Kinks were middle-class British. To be sure, you will find in these songs everything you'll find in most good pop songs: <em>love, loss, lust and outer space, </em>to quote the band's press kit. But rather than coming at the material in the straight-forward <em>I'm a dude singing about my life</em> fashion, Busman's Holiday prefer to clothe their emotions in the garb of struggling novelists, pining geriatrics (the A-side and B-side of this single, respectively), dying aliens, midlife crisis suffering car salesmen, recently fired corporate hotshots, &amp;c.\r\n\r\n<strong>Busman's Holiday</strong> also share with The Kinks some serious attention to humor (can you even count how many puns are tucked into â€œThe Last Waltzâ€?), and an ability to be funny without disrespecting their characters. If you laugh, you're always laughing with, never at. It would be beyond easy to make the narrator of â€œ(William Crescent Gets) Firedâ€ into a big joke, a money-grubbing sap who chose the wrong path in life and got what he deserved for putting all his eggs in a corporate basket. But the song doesn't do any of these things. In fact, it becomes an unlikely fight song for redemption. When William Crescent sings to his old boss <em>I'll be ahead of the rest I'll be the best I don't care I'll be underrated, </em>you want to cheer him on. It doesn't hurt their cause, musically speaking, that the brothers <strong>Rogers (Addison </strong>on a drumkit with a suitcase bass drum, <strong>Lewis</strong> on guitar) have an astonishing grasp of melody and form, as well as the kind of pristine, telepathic harmony singing that only siblings (and occasional husband-wife duos) seem to be able to master.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-Side â€œDaniel's Lamentâ€</strong> follows the progress of a novelist's attempt to evade a sophomore slump. And there actually is progress in the songs narrative. In the first verse, with our narrator (Daniel, presumably) suffering from writer's block, the song is certainly a lament: <em>I've lost my touch / what will I do?</em> But by the end of the song, Daniel has fought his demons and the novel is worth that much more to him for it: <em>this book has turned my whole world around / I was lost / but now am found.</em> I don't know when the last time was I heard a song that actually changed in mood from the first to the last verse. Storytelling in song has generally fallen out of fashion these days (except for R. Kelly, bless his soul), but while most of their musical contemporaries rely on vague evocations and endlessly repeated choruses, <strong>Busman's Holiday </strong>are writing songs that never stop moving. What really stands out about the lyrics of â€œDaniel's Lamentâ€ is the wisdom couched in the story. Daniel's struggles are essential to his success. He succeeds by shutting himself up in a room and working until he gets it done. Hardly the drama you'd expect from a pop song, but it rings all the more true because of what seems like humble subject matter.\r\n\r\nAnd all that is not to even mention the music. From the very first line of the melody, you can hear that the <strong>Rogers'</strong> have not only fantastic singing voices (pitch-perfect without sounding glossy or otherwise losing human texture) but a sense of melody that is as unusual as it is lovely. The song's opening guitar pattern is something we can almost hear without hearing. Pleasant, propulsive, but we've heard similar things, and we can't help but immediately begin to place other, familiar melodies over the top of it. But the second that twisting vocal melody enters, there's no other song this could be. The verse melodies then proceed to hit the upbeats so hard they practically overturn the song. The whole piece immediately feels as if it's headed somewhere. By the time the bouncy bass clarinet joins in we're sure, and when it pours into the lovely chorus melody, we've arrived. There is so much attention to detail in the way the word â€œroundâ€ at the end of the chorus so easily and gently modulates, leaving us with a jarring leap back to the original key at the start of the next verse. The Rogers brothers build their songs with an enormous amount of care, and it shows.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œOde To Sophiaâ€</strong> is a goofy, sweet banjo love song narrated by an 89 year old who's been pining for the same woman since the second World War. In spite of the silliness of the song, there is something moving about the idea of the wish being fulfilled after so long, meaning a great deal less in some ways and a great deal more in others. True to form, the vocal harmonies all ring true, and the harmonic structure of the song is full of twists and turns that are rooted in Tin Pan Alley rather than indie rock. The song also contains a jazz joke so unbelievably nerdy that I'm not even going to explain it because then you will know that I got it and everyone will be embarrassed. No, let's just forget it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Addison</strong> and <strong>Lewis</strong> spend a great deal of their time on the road busking (hence the suitcase bass drum), and it comes through in their music manyfold. First, playing outside is the ultimate vocal training. There are no vocal monitors, no walls to bounce your voice back to you, and you have to fill the biggest room in the world with your voice. It's like swinging a baseball bat with a donut. Three donuts. Made of lead. After that, the bat itself feels like a twig. So it's no wonder the Rogers' can sing so deftly and powerfully after years of busking. The other relevant element of street performing is that your audience is not only <em>not</em> made up of paying customers, it's made up of people who are probably on their way somewhere and actively do not want to stop and be entertained by some kids with a guitar. This means it requires a hell of a lot of showmanship to win their ears in the first place, and even more to keep them there. There is a mention of vaudeville in the bands bio, and this is where it comes in. If you want busy people to stop and listen, you have to make them smile, and a touch of humor will do that like nothing else. But after that, Busman's Holiday knows how to keep you there with a color-saturated melody or a deft arranging touch. These gentlemen are on a mission to win over the world and they just might be able to do it.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Daniel's Lament [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM125 Busmans Holiday/01 Daniels Lament.mp3|titles=Daniel's Lament|artists=Busmans Holiday]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Ode To Sophia [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM125 Busmans Holiday/02 Ode To Sophia.mp3|titles=Ode To Sophia|artists=Busmans Holiday]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM125 Busmans Holiday.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

I like that, forcing your ears to see in 3D and Technicolor. Someone told me that they thought it was punk folk, while another folk punk. Iâ€™ve heard Emo, Post-Emo, Emoricana. I think thatâ€™s what you get when you follow four straight years of Brand New with four straight years of Neutral Milk Hotel.\"</em>\r\n\r\nSo opens <strong>John Michael's</strong> Ampeater submission as <strong>SAVES!</strong>. A home recording project of the highest caliber, SAVES! is Michael's Neutral Milk, his Mt. Eerie, the ultimate chance to create without letting others sublimate his best ideas, or as he puts it, without <em>\"being a douche to my friends.\"</em> The result is something catchy but strange, full of wit and yet entirely humble. It's simultaneously erudite and plebian, capturing timess situations and relationships through a distinctly modern lense.\r\n\r\nAs much as the phrase <em>\"home recording project\"</em> might suggest some hardly listenable lo-fi tape detritus, <strong>SAVES!</strong> benefits from a strong pop aesthetic, and shows more than a hint of influences that are borderline taboo in my line of work. It's not particularly cool to sound like Brand New or Dashboard Confessional, but both of these ostracized beasts peek out from the abyss and lend a wholly positive influence to various aspects of the SAVES! 7-inch. It's a busy intersection where folk and indie meet, and it's consequently well managed with street signs, stop lights, and all manner of proper guidance as to how one might navigate these streets on foot, by bike, or car. There are rules as to how these genres interact, and for the most part they're followed flawlessly either by incident or intent. Indie and emo on the other hand meet on lawless ground, somewhere near where Johnny faced the Devil way down in south Georgia. But you all remember how Johnny schooled that Devil, and walked off proudly into the sunset. Well, our John Michael is a similar hero, incorprating a vocal style that's markedly \"emo\" and combining it with the instrumental textures we've come to expect from indie home recording projects. Couched in the familiar sounds of organ and glockenspiel, I'm entirely willing to accept and even embrace the fact that he sounds a bit like Chris Carrabba. Plus there's an element to the music that's just plain weird and at times event dissonant. It all adds up to something that resonates equally with stuffy music bloggers and uninitiated teens. There aren't many records I can share with my little cousin, but this is one we'd both dig.\r\n\r\nLike <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem122\">Ghost/Light</a> or <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem120\">Wicked Yawnz</a>, <strong>SAVES!</strong> is a musical document in so much as it tries to describe and encapsule the mixed feelings of grandeur and trepidation that seem to strike most young men at twenty. \"<em>Somethingâ€™s been brewing for years, and continues to brew, and as I perfect it I pour out little tastes of pieces of me that I donâ€™t need so much anymore. I want to sing about being a nobody, about fearing what your anonymity means on a dinky planet spinning around a super-typical star. And I want to sing about realizing your connection to existence at large to experience being monstrous and miniscule all at once. Four years of college got me obsessed with metaphor and message, and mixed in with all the experimentation and energy of school I decided I wanted to use music to recreate certain emotions that I knew would be dulled with age. And isnâ€™t that what art is, an attempt to communicate with a later generation? To show how much weâ€™ve grown while staying so much the same?\" </em>\r\n\r\nI've always admired lyricists who can incorporate distinctly modern lingo into their songs. For some reason, I find it offputting when words like <em>\"cell phone\"</em> or <em>\"Facebook\"</em> are thrown around in pop music. They're not part of the vocabulary I've come to expect from the American songbook, and stand out as a weak attempt to write \"relevant\" folk songs. It's stupid that verses about coal mining somehow seem more appropriate than ones about social networking, but so it goes. I think part of my reluctance to accept modern terminology is the result of widespread poor musical phrasing. If you're ready to take that step and sing about modern situations using modern vocabulary, it has to be done with a certain amount of grace and an awareness that listeners might recoil at the the particular sonorities you're introducing into the cannon. Not only does <strong>John Michael</strong> of <strong>SAVES!</strong> do this gracefully, he does it <em>masterfully</em>. The melodic contour of <strong>A-Side \"Scene Girl\"</strong> is so perfectly crafted that the lyrics roll forth with ease, drafting in the wake of the vocal line. He sings:\r\n\r\n<em>I found you among droves of glamourous proles</em>\r\n<em>As eye liner fell as though rain.</em>\r\n<em>Text messages beeping you gracefully sleeping</em>\r\n<em>Electric friends twist in your brain.</em>\r\n\r\nThe song kicks off with a percussive countoff on the body of an acoustic guitar before flooding with lush organ that ushers in one of the strongest vocal performances I've heard in a solo project of this magnitude. The two chord harmonic alternation in the organ leaves room for a lead vocal line with some vertical movement, and as a result the whole song comes across as one big hook. The lyrical content might also hit home for some, in particular our readers over yonder in Brooklyn. <strong>Michael</strong> explains: <em>I was pretty peeved about how hipster girlsâ€™ beauty was directly correlated their vacuousness. I wanted to save one from her life after 30. Perhaps the hipsters will dig the irony of a song making fun of them while simultaneously lusting after them.</em>\" From what I hear, hipsters love irony.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side \"The Grapevine\" </strong>is the kind of song that feigns epic and ultimately delivers a kind of frigid isolation. Again utilizing a decidedly modern vocabulary, this is a song rich in wit that reminds us just how shitty life can be. You have to take a second to appreciate lines like <em>\"</em><em>telling lies is just more fun / when every friend you have has to be blocked / but Lord Murdoch\"</em> and <em>\"You play Beatrice / I've got Benedick down / our raillery will keep ado bound,\" </em>the latter of which refers to Shakespeare's <em>Much Ado About Nothing. </em>English majors of the world unite.\r\n\r\nThis song's greatest success is the tension laid atop each verse by dissonant harmonies in the piano. <strong>Michael</strong> assures me this tune is killer live, and I believe him. His voice is already on the cusp of spilling over into a full-fledged scream at several points, and thrown atop a band stocked with real live vocal harmonies, the climactic final verse would be magnificent. <strong>SAVES!</strong> has thus far seen limited exposure in live form, and was both conceived and executed as a bedroom studio project. That said, Michael has <em>\"new material in the works,\" </em>so we'll see whether SAVES! starts making appearances on the New England indie circuit. If they do, be sure to arrive early to get first pick of the scene girls.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Scene Girl [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM126 SAVES/01 Scene Girl.mp3|titles=Scene Girl|artists=SAVES!]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - The Grapevine [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM126 SAVES/02 The Grapevine.mp3|titles=The Grapevine|artists=SAVES!]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM126 SAVES.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

It's a phrase that somehow conjurs an image of our country as mother to a mystical culture of poets and balladeers who masquerade by day as farmers and coal miners. According to Marcus, it's <em>\"the old, weird America\"</em> that Smith somehow captured in his now famous anthology, and it's this same spirit that's been used to describe figures from Bob Dylan to David Berman. Travis mentions this below as part of the <em>\"great tradition of heady North American songwriters.\"</em> But somehow I've always felt that this continuum was something built by critics in some desperate attempt to make enough bizarre cross-generational connections that they might have something to say for however many pages they needed to say it. Bob Dylan and David Berman are certainly old and weird, but I'm not sure they fully embrace the idea of an old, weird America. It's a wonderful phrase, and sits as an untouchably concise summation of the Harry Smith Anthology, but for all practical purposes, it should stop there. What <strong>Uncles</strong> offer instead is a <em>\"new, weird America\"</em>--one that they somehow see, and that the rest of us don't. It's so easy to fetishize life as it once was, but Uncles see strangeness in the mediocrity of the present. When you walk through New York city, what do you notice? Maybe you turn a bit to catch a glimpse at a stunningly beautiful woman (there are plenty in our fine city), maybe you stop and look up at a historic building (there are plenty of those too), maybe you go out of your way to walk through Central Park in mid-Spring. Or, maybe you're one of those \"artsy\" types, who takes pictures of homeless dudes, crumbling infrastructure, and bleak winter landscapes. <strong>Will Schwartz </strong>and <strong>Danny Bateman </strong>are interested in the place between these two extremes: the overweight but otherwise pleasant-looking Latino mother, sitting on her front stoop knitting; endless blocks of storefronts with fading but otherwise operational neon signs, and the abundance of commonplace scenes that are constantly being enacted in New York's five borroughs. To most of us they're nondescript, uninteresting, and neither so pleasant they're coveted nor so discomfiting they're fascinating. It's the accurate portrayal of life as its actually lived, and to achieve this is a rare gift indeed.\r\n\r\nWe've yet to host a Casual Business session with a band we didn't like both personally and musically, but rarely do we get along with people as well as we did with <strong>Uncles.</strong> Topics ranged from music (duh) to shock porn (?!) and everything in between. If you're interested in hearing and seeing a bit more from the session, our friends over at BreakThru Radio cut an hour-long show with Uncles before we let our hair down and set Casual Business to tape. You can listen to the full BTR session <a href=\"http://www.breakthruradio.com/#/post/?blog=94&amp;post=88\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and watch the abridged video edition <a href=\"http://www.breakthruradio.com/#/post/?blog=85&amp;post=934\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. If you're still hanking for more Uncles, you can read the 7-inch review that started it all right <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem092\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>As usual, we've invited engineer and dude extraordinare Travis Harrison to give us his thoughts on the session:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong><strong>Will Schwartz</strong> and <strong>Danny Bateman</strong>, a symbiotic pair of singer/lyricists not exceeding their early twenties, brought the expressive rhythm section of <strong>Tom White</strong> (upright bass) and <strong>Duncan Berry</strong> (drums) to my studio for a beery September weeknight session that hatched these gems. These two songs serve as an excellent introduction to Schwartz and Bateman's rare approach to making songs. Both <strong>\"Clarinets\"</strong> (written and sung by Schwartz) and <strong>\"Green Apple Skoal\"</strong> (written and sung by Bateman) require an active listenership and a willingness to commit, participate, and follow along with their streams of unstill language. Beneath it all, haunting chords and beautiful melodies unfold in some unexpected surprises.\r\n\r\n<strong>Uncles</strong> makes music that will inspire the neurons in your cerebellum to cut a rug and set your heart of hearts aflutter,  but don't expect escapism and disco balls. This is music carved from a great tradition of heady North American songwriters, presumably beginning with Bob Dylan and continuing with Leonard Cohen and David Berman, who build temples of exquisitely carved poetry atop folk formations. The words are the focus here. It takes a lot of guts to make music like this, to lay it out there, to offer your contributions to this vital stream. Open your mind and your heart to your new Uncles.\r\n\r\n<em>Recorded by Travis Harrison at Serious Business Music, NYC on September 10, 2010</em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em>Dan Bateman: guitar, keyboard, lead vocals\r\nWill Schwartz: guitar, keyboard, lead vocals\r\nDuncan Berry: drums\r\nThomas White: upright bass\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Clarinets [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CB03 Uncles/01 Clarinets.mp3|titles=Clarinets|artists=Uncles]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Green Apple Skoal [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CB03 Uncles/02 Green Apple Skoal.mp3|titles=Green Apple Skoal|artists=Uncles]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both;

Â Educated listeners may know better than to anticipate barefoot Bob Dylan, but theyâ€™ll still harbor preconceptions which, albeit considerably better informed, are nonetheless the product of reflex.\r\n\r\n<strong>Whale Bellyâ€™s</strong> music borrows stylistically from folk, but it also exhibits shades of rock, pop, blues, and western classical, and there are certainly a number of bands today playing in a more obviously folksy vein.Â  Nevertheless, the link becomes clearer when you strip away the connotations and focus on the terminology itself.Â  Folk signifies not just music but a way of life, the simple life, and a rejection of the â€˜bigger, faster, strongerâ€™ ethos that fuels the so-called American dream. Â In that regard, Whale Belly is aÂ bona fideÂ folk band.Â  The music doesnâ€™t stem indirectly, via the genre \"Folk Music\".Â  It stems directly from the source, evoking the philosophy that sparked the genre in the first place.Â  It doesnâ€™t matter that the band members are children of the digital age, residing in the most urban of localesâ€”Whale Belly projects a simultaneous love for humanity and contempt for the society humanity has subscribed to that would make Woody Guthrie proud.\r\n\r\nAt heart, Whale Belly is not just a band but a community of friends.Â  Youâ€™ll find anywhere from 4 to 15 musicians onstage during the typical Whale Belly set.Â  The focus of this musical community is on creating a dynamic show rather than a polished CD or appearing hip.Â  Those involved put as little distance between themselves and the audience as possible.Â  Vocalist and multi-instrumentalist <strong>Todd Bogin</strong> explains, â€œ<em>we work really hard at involving the crowd and making them feel a part of the whole thing</em>.â€ The group frequently performs stunt like having the crowd jump up on stage to sing along.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s also clearly not about the money, as <strong>Whale Belly</strong> is offering up its entire debut album, <em>The Smile at the End of the Slope</em>, for <a href=\"http://www.whalebellymusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">free download</a>.Â  Incidentally, this album makes a perfect introduction to the band.Â  It gathers up the chaotic reverie of the moment and miraculously packs it into a slender little disc that can be spun again and again.Â  Needless to say, it doesnâ€™t fit so cleanly, and casual listeners may view the recordings as cluttered or even sloppy.Â  Some tracks have so much going on that itâ€™s difficult to pick individual parts out of the mix.Â  However, so much seems unavoidable when you have a ten-track album featuring 23 different musicians on instruments ranging from violins to Wurlitzers.Â  The recordings are about as close to a live set in a packed and slightly inebriated club as you can get without stepping out of your apartment.Â  The sincerity and intimacy of the music are completely unabridged.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the live aesthetic, the album is supplemented with original artwork by <strong>Bogin</strong>, which adds a personal and decidedly playful touch to every song.Â  Iâ€™ve included the images for both songs in this review and the rest can be downloaded on the bandâ€™s website along with the album.Â  As youâ€™ll notice, darker themes are dressed in the bright colors and cartoon abstraction of youthful optimism.Â Â  Not a bad metaphor for the band.\r\n\r\nEven the name is revealing, foreshadowing the lyrical content of the album.Â  We could view the slope as symbolic of the struggles that we must endure to make ends meet and arrive at something to smile about, but thatâ€™s not the whole story.Â  The name also pays homage to the bandâ€™s neighborhood, Brooklynâ€™s South Slope, while riffing off clichÃ©s like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow or the light at the end of the tunnel.Â  This clever double entendre is only the tip of the iceberg, for youâ€™ll find that <strong>Whale Belly</strong> has a penchant for wordplay that's evident throughout its catalogue.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-3279\" title=\"Odds and Ends\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Odds-and-Ends-300x252.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"252\" />In <strong>A-Side â€œOdds and Endsâ€</strong> Whale Belly takes a stock phrase, flips it on its end, and uses the resulting deviation as a platform to explore a complex social phenomenon, unfounded biases and our reluctance to accept differences.\r\n\r\n<em>It's odds and ends, ends and odds</em>\r\n<em>We're both the same person, just believe in different gods</em>\r\n<em>Mine is cruel and yours is slyâ€¦</em>\r\n\r\nThe listener finds an ironic twist at every turn, culminating in the parallel structure of the refrain:\r\n\r\n<em>I know what I hate but I just donâ€™t know why.</em>\r\n\r\nThe constant double entendre allows for an economy of language, since each phrase is packed with so many layers of meaning that <strong>Whale Belly</strong> manages to say a lot while saying very little.Â  As for delivery, <strong>Boginâ€™s</strong> voice grabs listenersâ€™ attention right away.Â  Itâ€™s not pretty and itâ€™s not always in tune, yet thatâ€™s often an asset in both Folk Music and music of the common folk alike.Â  Honesty is the goal and perfection is not honest.Â  Bogin delivers like a true balladeer and when I listen to Whale Belly, I feel as if Iâ€™m being told a story rather than merely sung a song.Â  And if the vocals seem abrasive, the music will temper that.Â  Tasty fiddle licks smooth out the rough spots, naturally driving the swells in volume and tempo and helping the arrangement gel together.Â  Meanwhile, snappy snare rolls, uptempo country guitar strumming, and a steady rockabilly bassline provide the tension and momentum to keep the listener engaged.\r\n\r\nIf you like what you hear, youâ€™ll also want to check out the <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/13725266\" target=\"_blank\">music video</a>.Â  It fits broadly with the theme of soul searching expressed in the lyrics and highlights the sense of movement conveyed by the musicâ€¦ but above all, itâ€™s fun!\r\n\r\n<strong><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-3280\" title=\"Poor Man's Dance\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Poor-Mans-Dance-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" />B-Side â€œPoor Manâ€™s Danceâ€</strong> is considerably more amped up than <strong>â€œOdds and Endsâ€</strong> and demonstrates the range of <strong>Whale Bellyâ€™s</strong> genre-hopping.Â  <strong>Bogin</strong> observes that when comparing the two, <em>â€œyou can easily see the diversity of the band and get an idea of how different each song on the album sounds.â€</em> Youâ€™ll still find a bit of folk perspective but the Folk Music is buried under a healthy slab of distortion.Â  The chorus even hints at a rock anthem, while the guitar generally leans toward blues.Â  Aurally, it may still seem like an abrupt transition but the lyrics and structure help it adhere to the Whale Bellyâ€™s aesthetic.Â  True to form, the band uses impeccable wordplay in treating some heavy issues.\r\n\r\nThe song hinges on the refrainâ€”also the title lyric<em>â€” â€œdo the poor manâ€™s danceâ€¦â€</em> To an extent, I feel like any song bold enough to reference its own dance and to order the listener to do it commands a certain degree of respect.Â  Such songs make it crystal clear that you damn well better shut up and dig it, even if the \"it\" is something as lewd as to \"superman that ho\" or as inane as the hokey-pokey.Â  In this case, the command is considerably more philosophical than either, but similarly self actualizing and, astonishingly, the first verse manages to reference the hokey-pokey without sounding stupid.\r\n\r\n<em>Put your whole life in</em>\r\n<em>Take your whole life out</em>\r\n<em>Take all your clothes</em>\r\n<em>and shake the money out</em>\r\n\r\nItâ€™s the ironic recasting of a poor man rifling through his pockets for change as an action so deliberate and artful as a dance.Â  Powerful juxtaposition.\r\n\r\nIn summary, check out the album because itâ€™s free and every song has something unique to offer!Â  If you have the time and means, check out <strong>Whale Belly</strong> in concert too, because despite all Iâ€™ve said about the live aesthetic of the album, nothing can completely replicate the thrill of joining in on the moment and arriving at that smile at the end of the slope.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td

Shake weights lie dormant in the corner of some long forgotten closet, nestled amongst unassembled bow-flex machines, \"The Idiot's Guide To Car Repair,\" and a complete set of  Rosetta Stone DVDs on how to learn Klingon. And this bothers us. So, we transfer our private frustrations to our colleagues, and thus begins February, the month of irrational professional fervor and widespread hypertension. If you're driven mad by the thought of opening Gmail for fear of what you might find lurking therein, this 7-inch is the panacea for all your mid-winter woes. Like omniscient musical deities, Danish Brooklynites <strong>Alcoholic Faith Mission</strong> have swooped down and bestowed two tracks upon us, that with their glacial pace and striking beauty are guaranteed to restore your fragile sense of inner tranquility. In truth, I'd expect nothing less from the hipster descendants of King HroÃ°gar, but I digress.\r\n\r\nHigh school chums <strong>Thorben SeierÃ¸ Jensen</strong> and <strong>Sune SÃ¸lund</strong> began making music under the name <strong>Alcoholic Faith Mission</strong> as a duo in 2006. Since then, the group's expanded to include <strong>Kristine Permild</strong>, <strong>Gustav Rasmussen</strong>, <strong>Morten Hyldahl</strong> and <strong>Anders Hjort</strong>, and now have three records and an EP to their wonderfully irreverent name. Though it can be tough to catch them live in the states, it's well worth a plane ticket to Helsinki to hear <strong>Alcoholic Faith Mission </strong>perform. There's a remarkable clarity of vision in their music that immediately spreads to listeners, and it's this infectious appreciation for the stillness of life that we could all use in abundance. They achieve this in part by avoiding extremes, favoring texture and harmony over rhythmic variation, and giving their music \"room to breathe.\" While you might reasonably expect (and fear) that this would translate into 20 minute Mogwai-esque slowbuild epics, Alcoholic Faith Mission instead channel these elements into reasonably succinct pop songs.\r\n\r\nOn first listen, just let this 7-inch wash over you. Don't pick apart the lyrics,  don't follow the song structure, and for the love of god don't try to figure out what settings they used on the Space Echo. Instead, imagine yourself laying face up in a shallow pool of perfectly warm water. The sun's shining down, you're unconditionally comfortable, and the music of <strong>Alcholic Faith Mission </strong>comes wafting towards you, as though floating on the breeze itself. This is, in my opinion, the best mental preparation for <strong>A-Side \"Feng Shui Me\"</strong>. There's a pervasive sheen to the music on this 7-inch, created in part by the quietly droning synths that grow out of nowhere to hover above the main vocal line. The consistent use of vocal doubling up an octave from the principle melody is so essential to the musical identity of both songs that it could very well be summarized as AFM's \"signature\" sound. With Jenson on the lower octave and Permild on the upper, it's almost unfair to distinguish between main and harmony vocals. The two parts combine so successfully and with such delicate awareness that they function almost as a single voice. Two acoustic guitars (one strumming, one noodling) and a handful of scattered percussion fill out the song. There are no real drums to be heard, but the sonic palette nevertheless feels complete. Some shakers guide us along during the chorus, and the guitar parts work in combination to outline a sense of unhurried time. The song comes to a close on a long fadeout that leaves us with 25 seconds of quiet contemplation before <strong>B-Side \"Tennessee\"</strong> gets underway with an abandoned guitar figure and studio countdown. It then opens with an organ drone that persists throughout the song, anchoring listeners and providing a focal point for the instrumental fragments that weave the texture of this brief but beautiful song. Once again we find ourselves in a world where acoustic guitar, solo cymbal,  and a bit of shaker do the heavy lifting in keeping time. Background parts are provided by piano, electric guitar, and a bassline that mirrors the piano's three note ascending figure. The song winds to a close with the musical equivalent of fireworks, as acoustic guitar embellishments accelerate into digitally clipped arpeggios. It ultimately ends as it began, with a solo organ.\r\n\r\nI went through a brief 6 year phase during which I listened almost exclusively to Neil Halsted's post Slowdive mellow-rock project Mojave 3. <strong>Alcoholic Faith Mission</strong> makes use of the same components (male/female vocal exchange, acoustic guitars as rhythmic propulsion, ambient synth drones) in a slightly different permutation, and to arguably greater effect. While I always felt like there was some great sadness behind Mojave 3's slow tempo epics, Alcoholic Faith Mission's songs simply exude optimism. Watch their faces during a live show, and you'll be left with little doubt about the implicit message delivered through their music: just fucking enjoy yourself, man. There's none of this gloomy indie rock star nonsense, just six people on a stage, smiling and singing their asses off. This isn't the introspective mood-inflected rollercoaster ride one might get from Sigur Ros or solo Billy Corgan. Rather, it's an ongoing ode to joy, sung with unbridled earnestness by a bunch of Europeans who don't fully understand that it's not wholly cool to be happy in Brooklyn. The resulting sound is astoundingly tight, with little of the character (read: out of tune vocals, sloppy instrumentalists, bad production) that we've come to expect in indie music. It's possible that this polished approach might even lose those listeners who would rather listen to In the Aeroplane over the Sea on repeat. But whereas Neutral Milk Hotel is apt to turn away those who aren't willing to bend a little in its direction, Alcoholic Faith Mission's musical door is wide open to all comers. Hell, they don't even have a door, just a big banner that says \"We love everybody!\" draped across the main street of our minds. So if the onslaught of winter pandamonium has you in full retreat, let Alcoholic Faith Mission help you slip away to your special place, or better yet, to realize you don't have to.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Feng Sui Me [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM128 Alcoholic Faith Mission/01 Feng Shui Me.mp3|titles=Feng Shui Me|artists=Alcoholic Faith Mission]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Tennessee [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM128 Alcoholic Faith Mission/02 Tennessee.mp3|titles=Tennessee|artists=Alcoholic Faith Mission]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM128 Alcoholic Faith Mission.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Never before in New Yorkâ€™s long and illustrious history of shit-weather had a year been ushered in with such force. Other cities throughout the region fared little better. Bostonâ€™s Logan Airport received 38 inchesâ€”a figure rendered only bleaker for its failure to break any records. In cities everywhere, plowmen worked overtime to clear the roads, evasively deflecting whatever lay in their paths toward the parking lanes where icy mountains rose up and then thawed, spawning rivers of toxic sludge. Escape was nearly impossible. The rustic pleasure of sleeping on the floor failed to sate the rage of passengers stranded for days at JFK. Conditions were evidently so bad that it took an entire revolution in Egypt to push everyoneâ€™s bitching out of front page news. But I wonder whether conditions have really been so much worse than usual?\r\n\r\nEven without unprecedented snowfall, winter has several strikes against it. Brutal cold and interminable nights are two big ones. These invariably result in higher incidence of suicide, divorce, and people seeking therapy. Crime rates drop marginally but only because nobody wants to venture outside. Naturally, weâ€™re all tempted to succumb to the seasonal gloom and overdose on bleak music by artists from places even colder than Gotham City.Â  Iâ€™ve passed months wallowing through audio tours of the Arctic Circle, meandering from Norway to Iceland to Siberiaâ€”<em>Opeth, Sigur Ros, Tchaikovsky</em>â€”in self indulgent angst. Â This winter, however, I headed to Los Angeles where I discovered <strong>The Smiles</strong>. Many bands with a name so cheerful and idiotic would be quickly torn to shreds in the smog of cynicism that pervades the East-Coast indie circuit. Luckily, The Smiles have enough merit to win a place in even the coldest of hipster hearts.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s cleanse the palate! Youâ€™ve been listening to far too much Eliot Smith for your own good and you havenâ€™t laughed in weeks. Press play and digest the first ten seconds of <strong>A-Side â€œCala Colaâ€</strong> before reading on. Ten seconds is all youâ€™ll need to don the appropriate mindset because <strong>The Smiles</strong> waste no time in cutting to the pointâ€”they canâ€™t afford to when the longest track on their six-track debut, <strong><em>Hermosa</em>, </strong>clocks in at just over three minutes! The songwriting throughout the album is remarkably concise. Each song covers impressive ground without ever testing the limits of your attention span. Moreover, The Smiles never temper the beach-rock attitude which distinguishes them from virtually every other indie band hip enough to appreciate. Each song develops at a leisurely pace.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Smiles</strong> have already earned considerable acclaim in California but theyâ€™re ready to become a national phenomenon. This is, at least in part, because Vampire Weekend paved the way for them. Anyone who has listened to ten seconds of â€œCala Colaâ€ may have drawn that comparison already. Itâ€™s been drawn several times, which bodes well for the California quartet. The East Coast adored Vampire Weekend, so it seems predisposed to accept The Smiles. The Smiles may even have a crucial edge over Vampire Weekend. <strong>John McGrath </strong>(guitar) and <strong>Will Sturgeon</strong> (bass) split lead-vocal duties, and their starkly different voices emphasize key moments in compositional narrative. This notion is epitomized by â€œCala Colaâ€, in which vocal contrast clearly delineates the shift between verse and pre-chorus. Nevertheless, the two bands have enough in common that Vampire Weekend makes an ideal point of reference anybody unfamiliar with The Smiles. Aesthetic hallmarks of each include jangly electric guitars blurred by ethereal reverb, propulsive basslines with enough high-mids to cut through the mix, and the crisp pop of tightened drumheads. Moreover, both groups write songs with simple chord progressions, memorable melodies, world rhythms, and clearly delineated structure. Another less obvious ground for comparison might be biographical. Both bands formed in college, albeit on the opposite side of the country.\r\n\r\nThis geographical distinction leads us to a crucial point of divergence. <strong>The Smiles</strong> and Vampire Weekend arrive at a similar auditory aesthetic, but they do it via starkly different philosophies. To put it another way, <strong>â€œCala Colaâ€ </strong>sounds a lot like â€œCape Cod Kwassa Kwassaâ€ but nobodyâ€™s pitching it as a critique of colonial exploitation. <em>â€œWe're just trying to write good short pop songs,â€</em> explains vocalist and bassist <strong>Will Sturgeon.</strong> Though well educated, <strong>The Smiles</strong> wonâ€™t be writing any songs about obsolete syntax.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-Side â€œCalifornia Girlsâ€</strong> is testament to this. <strong>The Smiles</strong> tell me it was influenced by The Strokes but the one-note build and tribal tom-tom introduction alludes more directly to another well known California band to which the group have drawn much comparisonâ€”The Beach Boys. Touches of youthful exuberance like the subtle yelp before the second chorus and the bass breakdown at the onset of the bridge cement the surf-rock vibe. The last chorus is truly explosive, buoyed by vocal lines that weave back and forth and synch up at key moments in satisfying harmony. What more could one hope for from a song called California Girls?\r\n\r\nOf course, <strong>The Smiles</strong> are more than your run-of-the-mill surfer band. <em>â€œWe didn't set out to be beachy,â€</em> explains <strong>Sturgeon</strong>, <em>â€œbut once we moved to a full band setting and Brendan's reverb got involved then there wasn't much we could doâ€¦ We got our roots playing college parties, so the louder we could play the better, and basically that's how all these songs sound.â€</em> Both Sturgeon and <strong>McGrath</strong> have folk roots which they plan to exhibit in subsequent releases. Even <em><strong>Hermosa</strong></em> demonstrates more breadth than meets the eye. With repeat listens, the subtle intelligence begins to shine.\r\n\r\nFew indie bands could choose a name like <strong><em>â€œThe Smilesâ€</em> </strong>and get away with it. <strong>The Smiles</strong> are one of them, and they donâ€™t even have to pretend that itâ€™s ironic! They exude a lot of positive energy but it comes across as sincere rather than overmedicated. Maybe it really is just the weather? This has led many listeners to speculate whether The Smiles represent the trajectory that Vampire Weekend might have taken if they'd gone to USC instead of Columbia. Would they still have chosen to name their band after a blood-sucking nightwalker with a melatonin deficiency? Â The Smiles represent a light hearted alternative to the esoteric/existential indie archetype without sacrificing an ounce of integrity. If you suffer from seasonal depression, this upbeat and highly addictive indie-pop might be just what you need!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Cala Cola [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM129 The Smiles/01 Cala Cola.mp3|titles=Cala Cola|artists=The Smiles]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - California Girls [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM129 The Smiles/02 California Girls.mp3|titles=California Girls|artists=The Smiles]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM129 The Smiles.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Some music sits still. Some music serves to bring a degree of class to the social calendar of the captains of High Culture and High Finance. <strong>Shapers</strong> make none of that music. The Chicago four piece are gleeful collagists, roping in everything within their reach: improvised music; gleeful math rock; softly glowing, ambient synth jams; somber, sparse psych tunes laden with vocal harmonies; rolling afro-cuban percussion; David Byrne-style shout vocals. And none of these things are segregated neatly into their own tracks. They're combined with a free and generous hand, mixing and overlapping so much that you forget they wouldn't ordinarily share a record label, let alone a song. Shapers <a href=\"http://shapers.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp page</a> tags them as <em>post-genre,</em> which in most cases would be either dry irony or unwarranted cockiness, but the slurry of influences on the band's debut full-length <strong>Little, Big </strong>makes one of the strongest cases for that particular phrase I've yet heard.\r\n\r\nMore impressive yet, the band, composed of guitarist <strong>Zaid Maxwell,</strong> synth player <strong>Amelia Styer</strong>, bassist/guitarist <strong>Steve Reidell</strong>, and drummer <strong>Todd Waters</strong>, manages to escape the trap that so many genre-hopping, odd-meter-loving bands fall into. <strong>Shapers</strong> aren't weird for weird's sake. They use their sharp left turns in service of their songs, turning stylistic fragments into coherent pieces with a solid sense of form that feels both natural and surprising. Though you never know quite where the band is going, you never doubt that <em>they </em>know. Because of how integrated their influences are, they also manage to control and vary the tone of their songs perfectly. The songs aren't merely exercises in complexity, they range from ecstatic to grave (in spite of titles like â€œHot Gravy Availableâ€ and â€œWhen I Was A Zygote,â€ Shapers is not one of those emotionless proggy bands who ignore mood-setting altogether, usually with tiresome results) and they never put you down in the same place they picked you up.\r\n\r\nThe two songs on their Ampeater single land on the thrashier end of the <strong>Shapers</strong> spectrum. <strong>A-side â€œVirginia Reelâ€ </strong>starts high and climbs higher. The song finds the band launching into a minute of some of their poppiest material, the juxtaposition of <strong>Maxwell</strong> &amp; <strong>Styer's</strong> gentle, high vocals and the barreling bass &amp; drums sounding almost like <strong>Yo La Tengo.<em> </em></strong>As the chorus kicks in, Styer's multitracked voice provides a lovely cushion for Maxwell's<strong> </strong>falsetto. As soon as the chorus fades, just as our Pop Pavlov Instinct kicks in and we start drooling in anticipation of another verse, a synth gradually wanders away from the western scale and then gradually multiplies into a dense thicket of atonal keyboards and riotous guitars. <strong>Waters</strong> bursts into a series of acrobatic fills and cymbal-smashing as the guitar/synth cloud gets louder and denser, louder and denser, and the whole thing lasts about as long as the entire verse-chorus structure that kicks the song off. Finally, just as the song is about to snap, it bursts into a new section, arcing even higher in energy with another wordless melody from Styer floating over the boiling rhythm section. The song never pauses to catch its breath. It must be tremendous fun live.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œHappy Birthday Polliwogâ€</strong> finds <strong>Maxwell</strong> shouting rather than cooing, and the band wasting no time in slamming through a 7/4 chorus with ferocious energy. The time disintegrates and reforms at a dizzying pace, and the second chorus is over before we even hit the minute mark. Listening to the beginning of <strong>â€œPolliwogâ€</strong> feels like riding a bucking bull, exhilarating, disorienting, and somewhat terrifying. The song then pares itself down to a tense eighth note pulse of floor toms and guitar clicks that rise and fall like deep breaths. Again, the climax comes from a long, dissonant instrumental, here created by the superimposition of several rising chromatic lines of different length, mostly fives, which overlap and shift against one another to form a sort of musical moire pattern, where the change occurs in how the parts line up rather than in the notes themselves. Again, just at the moment of collapse, there's an echo of the intro and it's over, leaving you to your own devices to stop your head from spinning. Songs like this are too compacted with material to be absorbed fully the first time; they demand and reward repeat listening.\r\n\r\nSurely <strong>Shapers</strong> won't appeal to everyone. Some people want music to murmur sweet nothings in their ear after work while they're cooking dinner. Still, there is something to commend music that demands attention, that doesn't sit back and allow itself to become background, especially in the age of the mp3, where music is playing around us more often than ever before and yet listened to less. Because these songs repeat themselves so little, they require constant attention. It's almost like listening to a conversation, where if you lose the narrative, you have to ask for it to be repeated. Coming straight into the middle of either <strong>â€œVirginia Reelâ€</strong> or <strong>â€œHappy Birthday Polliwogâ€</strong> would drastically alter the song, something that is also becoming less common at a time when form is increasingly determined by the limited capacities of looping and sampling. Sit and let the shapes of these songs hold your complete attention for a full six minutes. Let them work on you. You won't be quite the same afterwards.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Virginia Reel [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM130 Shapers/01 Virginia Reel.mp3|titles=Virginia Reel|artists=Shapers]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Happy Birthday Polywog [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM130 Shapers/02 Happy Birthday Polywog.mp3|titles=Happy Birthday Polywog|artists=Shapers]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM130 Shapers.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Wild</strong>?Â Â  Well, thatâ€™s a long story, and the sparknotes havenâ€™t been published.Â  Itâ€™s telling that I couldnâ€™t find a way to summarize <strong>Lucky &amp; Wild</strong> in a sentence, paragraph, or even in a 1000-word review.Â  I couldnâ€™t even select two tracks to adequately represent it.Â  In my defense, neither could those involved in the project.Â  Therefore, we decided to forgo the standard 7-inch in favor of posting the full <em>album</em>â€”if thatâ€™s even the right word for it.Â  Youâ€™ll have to experience it for yourself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first key to understanding <strong>Lucky &amp; Wild</strong> is to realize what it isnâ€™tâ€”an artist.Â  Lucky &amp; Wild should be approached as another entity altogether, for which thereâ€™s little precedent.Â  The project is a collaboration between musician <strong>Ben Seretan</strong> and visual artist <strong>Angus McCullough</strong>.Â  Seretan is best known as the vocalist and guitarist of <strong><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/duchampionband\" target=\"_blank\">Duchampion</a></strong>, a Brooklyn-based band that draws on rock, punk, and shoegaze.Â  I wonâ€™t delve into detail now because we hope to highlight Duchampion in a future 7-inch.Â  McCulloughâ€™s <a href=\"http://www.angusmccullough.com/\" target=\"_blank\">art and design</a> span several mediums.Â  A common thread throughout his work is his uncanny ability to evoke character, emotion, and storyline through unconventional means.Â  Seretan and McCullough also enlisted the help of filmmaker <strong>Spencer Sheridan </strong>of <strong><a href=\"http://nofaceperformance.org/\" target=\"_blank\">No Face</a></strong>, a Philadelphia-based performance group, and released theirâ€¦ err, whatever you want to call it, definitely not albumâ€¦ with the support of <strong><a href=\"http://www.mightykitten.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mighty Kitten Records</a></strong> under the Creative Commons License.\r\n\r\nCollaborations between musicians and visual artists invariably spawn cool results and <strong>Lucky &amp; Wild</strong> is no exception to this rule.Â  Still, Lucky &amp; Wild is not the usual breed of cool.Â  The brew is far stranger than the ingredients would indicate.Â  Letâ€™s discuss the recent release <strong>OOO</strong>, an unpronounceable title which <strong>Seretan</strong> describes as a <em>â€œtypographic and computer friendly way to represent three periods, three circles, etc.â€</em> and which is anything but an album.Â  In addition to eleven audio files, it includes a <a href=\"http://lucky-and-wild.com/video.html\">video</a>, photos, drawings, cryptic graphs supplemented by a series of â€˜renderingsâ€™<em> </em>that pose more questions than they resolve, excerpts from emails between <strong>Seretan</strong> and <strong>McCullough</strong>, a Cherokee fable and other obscure literary selectionsâ€”all vaguely related to the theme of <em>hummingbirds</em>, production notes as incomprehensible as Gertrude Steinâ€™s diary, and copious bibliographical credits.\r\n\r\nOf all these, the <a href=\"http://lucky-and-wild.com/video.html\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> provides the best point of accessâ€”insofar as itâ€™s a medium we can wrap our minds around and appreciate with relative ease.Â  Trippy visuals draw us into the dark universe of <strong>Seretanâ€™s</strong> music, where even the most self-assured will quickly begin to doubt their own sanity.Â  Itâ€™s like looking at a series of inkblots that seem too grotesque to be coincidental.Â  Is your therapist playing a trick on you?Â  However, the imagery is sufficiently abstract that you wonâ€™t be able to say for sure whether the shapes swelling and dissipating in the smoke are real or just figments of your fucked up imagination.\r\n\r\nFor those who wish to delve deeper, the correspondence between <strong>Seretan</strong> and <strong>McCullough</strong> provides biographical and philosophical context.Â  Seretan explains his inspiration for the workâ€”hanging around an abandoned arcade in triple-digit heat, surrounded by the sporadic blinks and flashes of glitchy machines, and taking in the <em>â€œghost echoes of lost decades of fun.â€</em> This was impetus for the pixilated arcade game motif, as well as the name <strong>Lucky &amp; Wild</strong>.Â  He also alludes to Marconiâ€™s theory that sound never truly dissipates, a cool idea to keep in the back of your mind as you sift through the content.\r\n\r\nThe other major theme of the releaseâ€”hummingbirdsâ€”is also addressed.Â  <strong>Seretan</strong> recounts a recent visit to the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum where he describes a <em>â€œkick-ass hummingbird trail.â€ </em>This may be the first time such words have been used to describe a hummingbird trail, but Seretan elaborates convincingly enough to diffuse any doubts regarding their propriety.Â  Â <em>â€œHummingbirds must see us humans as these huge, loafing, slow-moving monsters as they flitter about...surprisingly apt description of how my life here has felt.â€</em>\r\n\r\nNow that Iâ€™ve provided the background on <strong>Lucky &amp; Wild</strong>, Iâ€™ll leave you to explore at your own pace.Â  There may, in fact, be a method to the madness.Â  A few of the images and poems seem to carry encrypted messages but it might be purely aesthetic.Â  I havenâ€™t been able to crack the codeâ€”if it exists at allâ€”and even with an entire sheet of LSD to inspire me, I doubt Iâ€™d get any closer to a definitive truth.\r\n\r\nBecause <strong>Lucky &amp; Wild</strong> packages <strong>OOO</strong> as a single-click free download, we're tempted to dismiss it as the sort of work we can experience passively.Â  You can listen to the music.Â  You can watch the movie.Â  You can read the words.Â  However, to realize the full potential of OOO, youâ€™ll need to take a more active role.Â  OOO is avant-garde installation art.Â  Think of it as an exhibit in a box.Â Â  If you were a curator at MOMA, how would you install it?Â  Now take that mentality and apply it to your apartment.Â Â  Host a party.Â  Print out several copies of the text and give one to each of your guests as they arrive.Â  Distribute pot brownies, acid punch, etc. Release live hummingbirds.Â  Turn off all the lights.Â  Loop the audio in surround sound.Â  Project the images and videos on the walls and ceiling.Â  If you donâ€™t have a projector, a laptop will suffice.Â  The more laptops, the better, so ask your friends to help.Â  Position them strategically throughout the room.Â  Recruit a performer to recite a dramatic rendition of the parable of the Crane and the Hummingbird as the party unfolds.Â  Enjoy, and donâ€™t forget to invite your friends at Ampeater!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both;

Not that Brooklyn doesn't have all sorts of cultural weight. When I first moved here, a Finnish girl I'd just met asked me if Roberta's was really as good as everyone said. At the time I didn't even know what Roberta's was, and I was amazed to find out it was...a pizza place in Bushwick (Granted, it's an amazing one, and calling it a pizza place doesn't really do justice to how nice it is, but still). Because NYC is home to so many writers and publicists and videographers, and because everyone loves to publicize their friends, bands from Brooklyn, like pizza places, tend to take on cultural significance all out of proportion to their skill.\r\n\r\nBut while teenagers the world over thrill to the thought of Williamsburg, there is a quiet, steady stream of good music coming from the substantially larger Rest Of America (it's true! Look at a map!) . Places such as Cincinnati, whence we have <strong>The Seedy Seeds</strong>, a duo-turned-trio currently composed of <strong>Margaret Darling</strong>, <strong>Mike Ingram</strong>, and <strong>Brian Penick</strong>. Their PR material is blessedly brief (we're talking two sentences, one of which is about their dietary preferences), but I can tell you that what The Seedy Seeds do best, aside from write cheery pop songs with thoughtful lyrics and dreamy vocal harmonies, is swirl electronic and acoustic elements together in such a way as to make them sound like parts of a whole. The roles of the two types of instrument aren't segregated at all. Live drums lock into drum machines to form a percussion section, as if the drummer had one arm in each world; banjo and Korg share the stage at live shows; synth bass bubbles under acoustic guitar strums; human grunts become sampled percussive sounds, landing squarely in the territory between acoustic and electronic sound; accordion and violin surge in to replace synth pads; Casio handclaps abound. This whole complicated balancing act is then laid at the feet of songs that are unapologetically hooky and fun, with lyrics that at first appear planted squarely in the heart-on-sleeve world of boy girl synth pop, but which reveal layers of ambiguity on further listens.\r\n\r\nAmpeater <strong>A-Side â€œVerb Noun,â€ </strong>drawn from the band's hot off the presses <strong><a href=\"hotlink: http://theseedyseeds.bandcamp.com/album/verb-noun\" target=\"_blank\">Verb Noun LP</a></strong>, contains a moment that perfectly captures this acoustic/electronic melting pot. At 3:23, the drums drop out, leaving the vocals to rise above a pointillist forest of pizzicato violin, banjo plucks, and staccato synthesizer notes. The three sounds, spread across the stereo spectrum, mimic and mirror one another so closely that I'm still not actually sure which notes come from which instrument, and whether what I'm hearing as a synth is really a synth or whether it's another violin track or even some speedy, clean picking on the banjo. Of course, the beauty of the moment is just that: it doesn't even matter which sounds are acoustic in nature and which electronic. They all twine together so perfectly that they become one instrument, an instrument we've never heard before. The song itself goes through a number of phases of instrumentation, but wastes no time in snagging your ear on suspended bass and violin lines, light hearted acoustic guitar, expansive drums propelled along by the propulsive kick drum on the upbeats, and <strong>Darling </strong>and <strong>Ingram's</strong> voices woven together in pristine harmony. <strong>The Seedy Seeds </strong>are not fucking around: this is a pop song.\r\n\r\n<strong> â€œVerb Nounâ€</strong> is such a pop song that it doesn't even really seem to have verses, leaping from one soaring chorus-like melody to another for its entire duration. Along the way there are gushes of harmonized violins (note the way they move parallel to the vocals in the <em>just verb noun you'll agree</em><em> </em>section, serving almost as a chorus of vocal harmonies), assorted unidentifiable percussion (cowbell?), a banjo breakdown, lush call and response vocals, and a half-time drum machine beat laid over a full drum kit (which creates a strange slow-motion effect during the fade).\r\n\r\n<strong>B-side â€œTelephone the Constrictor,â€ </strong>from 2010's <strong>Roll Deep EP </strong>makes heavier use of electronics, with the whole song built around a thumping disco-derived chorus and an oscillating organ sound that calls to mind a ringing phone. Most of the percussion in the first verse is derived from voices (appropriate to the title/theme), whether they be <strong>Ingram's </strong>chopped up vocals or some Graceland-style grunts, which fit into the song as snug as a puzzle piece despite being, on the surface of things, a totally bizarre choice. Like so much of what <strong>The Seedy Seeds </strong>do (see: banjo breakdowns), it is somewhat counterintuitive, yet it's pulled off with enormous enthusiasm and energy, as if it never occurred to the band that most synth-pop eschews appalachian instruments for a reason. And the charm of the band, which is winning and substantial, derives directly from that surefooted fearlessness.\r\n\r\nIt would be a fallacy to claim at this point a really substantial disconnect between bands from Cincinnati and bands from Brooklyn. All of us who are online are part of the same community and we mostly hear the same music from some combination of the same sources. Still, there is something so unselfconsciously nerdy and fun about <strong>The Seedy Seeds</strong> that feels like it probably never would have coalesced in the style-obsessed northeast. They like hooks and choruses and sus chords and accordions and banjos and cuteness (not for nothing is their label called <strong>Eurodorable</strong>) and drum machines andÂ  why on earth would they not put all of those things together? Listening to this single, I think we can safely say that there's no reason at all why not.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, for those of you who, like me, might read about this particular combination of instruments and attitudes and react with jokes about <em>Hey can I get more iPod in my monitor </em>and what might politely be called skepticism, let me hit you with a quote from Sean Cannon of Buzzgrinder, on the Seeds live show: I assumed that a band using an iPod, accordion, kazoo, guitar and banjo had to be kitschy and, well, not too great. I was humbled. They tore it up.\r\n\r\n<strong>Catch the Seeds on the next leg of their Verb Noun tour:</strong>\r\nMarch 4<sup>th</sup>, North Star Bar, Philadelphia, PA\r\nMarch 5<sup>th</sup>, Union Hall, Brooklyn, NY\r\nMarch 7<sup>th</sup>, Great Scott, Boston, MA\r\nMarch 8<sup>th</sup>, Pianos, New York, NY\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Gabe Birnbaum</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Verb Noun [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM131 The Seedy Seeds/01 Verb Noun.mp3|titles=Verb Noun|artists=The Seedy Seeds]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Telephone the Constrictor [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM131 The Seedy Seeds/02 Telephone the Constrictor.mp3|titles=Telephone the Constrictor|artists=The Seedy Seeds]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM131 The Seedy Seeds.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

They're five white dudes in plaid shirts and denim pants just like me. They all wear glasses and I would too if I hadn't gotten the LASIK surgery years ago. When I made jokes related to flatulence or feces they laughed obligingly, especially Craig, who is known to lose it at the faintest whiff of deuce. We all enjoy cheap American lager because it gets you loose and also because somehow we like the way it tastes. Most of all, these dudes LOVE TO ROCK and that's an immersive pursuit I get down with daily.\n\nThey launched into their music, and for all its kinetic twists and surprising turns it's essentially verse chorus verse American power pop--but I don't mean that in a pejorative sense. They're drawing on timeless traditions and I think what they do is good for rock and roll in the sweeping sense. They rock without brooding or pretension. They embody the idea of a band as a gang. They look to deliver visceral rock thrills AND they cut to the heart at the same time. They're smart but not snarky. The songs feel universal but not vague. The band plays tight but not mechanical, loose but not sloppy.\n\nThe first part of this session was devoted to taping my BreakThruRadio show. Hear it <a href=\"http://www.breakthruradio.com/#/post/?dj=seriousmusic&amp;post=99&amp;blog=94&amp;autoplay=1\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and watch the video below. My BTR sessions tend to veer towards beery mostly because it's nervewracking to pretend to be a talk show host. I prefer a social atmosphere. This session was taped back before Four Loko was banned. I had some of that forbidden elixir and shouldn't have, because my sharp recollections have faded into foggy notions. I took notes, however. Here is a snapshot of my scribbles from the session:\n<table align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/photo.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3359\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Travis Sketch 2\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/photo-300x225.jpg\" /></a></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/photo-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3358\" style=\"width: 250px;\" title=\"Travis Sketch 1\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/photo-1-300x225.jpg\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nMiniboone ripped through 4 songs in the space it takes normal bands to do 2. It's not because they play short songs. It's because they love playing together so much they didn't want to leave my live room.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Travis Harrison</p>\n\n\n<hr style=\"border: 1px dashed #74857B;\" />\n\nI've been singing MiniBoone's praises for so long, and so loudly, I wouldn't be surprised if the echo's still ringing around some warehouses in Bushwick. I fucking love this band. We first met via the Ampeater submissions box almost exactly a year ago, and it's been a blur of showcases, interviews, and live sessions ever since (<a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem082\">you can check out my opening love letter to MiniBoone here</a>). As Travis mentioned in his note above, this is a real band, a real rock and roll band. MiniBoone carries the torch of an entire genre, and does it with such consistently infallible taste and enthusiasm that it's hard not to stand up and take notice. Whenever someone tries to give me the \"rock and roll is dead, man\" speech, I strike them sternly across the face and point them in the direction of MiniBoone. We couldn't drag these guys away from the mics, and before we knew it they had cut 4 magnificent tracks for this Casual Business (double) digital 7-inch.\n\nTo know engineer extraordinaire Travis Harrison is to have the music of Bruce Springsteen forced upon you with the obsessive loyalty of a religious zealot. After about a year of frustrated reluctance, I came around to The Boss during a stoney late night YouTube session featuring the 1978 E Street Band. Needless to say, Travis went apeshit when MiniBoone launched into their a cappella intro to \"Dancing in the Dark\". I mean, he was right to go nuts--there are covers, and then there are COVERS. MiniBoone owned this song, and made it their own without reservation or restraint. It's a sense one gets on most MiniBoone tunes, that they're somehow able to go just past the point of control without losing it altogether, and to snap back into sanity at the last possible moment. It's this particular knack that makes their music so fundamentally exciting, and delivers hooks by means of structural and textural variation in addition to the usual melodic tricks. Pay attention at the end of the track and you'll hear Travis enthusiastically humping the sliding glass door to the studio and then high-fiving every member of the band.\n\nIn a recent interview, I asked MiniBoone what their alter ego bands MegaBoone and MetaBoone might sound like. Taylor obligingly replied:\n\n<em><strong>MegaBoone:</strong> Music composed and performed by 1994 legend, Mega Man. He would have to take a hiatus from fighting the evil robot Wily, and since he was originally \"Rock Man\", this would be our biggest foe in a \"Rock Off\" competition. Sounds of lasers, mega-jumpz, and frustrated nerds would dominate each song. Mega would definitely require the help of his team members Proto Man, and Bass to defeat MiniBoone. This would all take place in a hybrid of \"Rock Band\" and \"Mega Man X\", to eventually become CAPCOM's most profitable story to date.</em>\n\n<em><strong>MetaBoone:</strong> This band would look MiniBoone, stink MB, sound MB, and wear the same custom fabrics that MB orders from Nepal each year. One exception though, when they perform live each MegaBooner would spontaneously pop like a balloon and confetti would shower the stage during their set closer \"Hilarious Currency\". Thus making only one live appearance for MetaBoone even possible.</em>\n\nI'm not sure whether this interview snippet contributes anything to readers' enjoyment of this session, or to the greater understanding of MiniBoone at large, but do I hope it conveys a vague sense that this isn't your average Brooklyn indie band, and convinces maybe a couple aspiring youths that even dudes who play MegaMan can grow up to be rock stars.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\n\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png');\" width=\"80px\"></td>\n<td>Side A - Brand New Thing [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CB04 MiniBoone/01 Brand New Thing.mp3|titles=Brand New Thing|artists=MiniBoone]</td>\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png');\" width=\"80px\"></td>\n<td>Side B - Chairs Are For Lovers [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CB04 MiniBoone/02 Chairs Are For Lovers.mp3|titles=Chairs Are For Lovers|artists=MiniBoone]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png');\" width=\"80px\"></td>\n<td>Side C - Man/Woman [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CB04 MiniBoone/03 Man_Woman.mp3|titles=Man/Woman|artists=MiniBoone]</td>\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url('http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png');\" width=\"80px\"></td>\n<td>Side D - Dancing in the Dark [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CB04 MiniBoone/04 Dancing in the Dark.mp3|titles=Dancing in the Dark|artists=MiniBoone]</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px text-align;\"><a href=\"/audio1/CB04 MiniBoone.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\n<table style=\"margin-top: 40px;\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-01-06-at-4.24.19-PM-300x169.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3360\" style=\"width: 200px;\" title=\"MiniBoone\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-01-06-at-4.24.19-PM-300x169.png\" /></a></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-01-06-at-4.22.59-PM-300x168.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3361\" style=\"width: 200px;\" title=\"MiniBoone\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-01-06-at-4.22.59-PM-300x168.png\" /></a></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-01-06-at-4.21.27-PM-300x169.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3362\" style=\"width: 200px;\" title=\"MiniBoone\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-01-06-at-4.21.27-PM-300x169.png\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fb6VrjSOMMs\" height=\"390\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n</div>",

The venue has a storied history of performers, including Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Suzanne Vega, and Jeff Buckley, but its real flair is making the everyday singer-songwriters that drift in and out seem as magical as these legendary musicians. Its bare rock walls, peeling wooden tables, and sturdy candelabras dripping with wax create an atmosphere of intense intimacy. No amplification or electricity of any kind is allowed. A small plaque on the wall reads \"Maximum Capacity: 35,\" which may have even been an optimistic assessment. It was, and remains, a truly special place, one of those increasingly rare nooks that provide New Yorkers with a complete escape from the chaos of upper Manhattan. It's there that I first met <strong>Zeb Gould</strong>.\r\n\r\nWhen you've spent the last two years listening to folk music every Friday and Saturday, you come to expect that a certain percentage of the performances are fueled largely by strong emotions and good intentions. Every once in a while someone arrives with decent chops, but by and large it's a silent competition to see who can make the most of three chords and recycled folk motifs. Then one evening <strong>Zeb Gould</strong> showed up with his 12 string guitar, and changed my perception of what I even thought possible for a performance of this magnitude. I felt as though John Fahey and Neil Young, in an effort to simultaneously squeeze through the door of our minuscule club, had somehow fused into a single inimitable force of virtuosic playing and nuanced composition. Zeb Gould seemed to have come from nowhere, and I was completely floored. I've been a fan ever since.\r\n\r\nYears later, his albums are still in regular rotation at Ampeater HQ, and I'm only now unraveling the mystery of what's gone into <strong>Gould's</strong> development as a musician. Mostly self taught, he apparently honed his chops in college on Leo Kottke, Michael Hedges, and the aforementioned John Fahey, and went on to work as an archivist for Philip Glass. If I were making a musical recipe for Zeb Gould, I might have forgot to add a dash of Philip Glass, but it now seems to obvious and so essential to Gould's approach to composition, that I'm almost embarrassed to have missed it. His explorations in Glass's studio produced his solo album <strong>\"All of the Morningbirds,\"</strong> and earned Gould opening spots with Gillian Welch, David Rawlings, Kim Ritchie, and Sue Garner. His follow-up album <strong>\"Stalk That Myth\"</strong> was released under the name <strong>Bowery Boy Blue</strong>, and this became Gould's permanent vessel for touring and further releases. His side projects include work with the <strong>Monika Jalili</strong> Persian music ensemble, and compositions for the <strong>White Wave Dance Company</strong> in Brooklyn, New York.\r\n\r\nI'm not one to argue for the purity of folk music--it's supposed to represent the confluence of influences in any given culture, and the American mixing pot provides an incredible range of inspiration. It's not surprising to learn that <strong>Gould</strong> has collaborated on projects with choreographers--his sense of soundscape, of creating a self-contained emotional space within each song, is extraordinary, and recommends itself in combination with other media, be it dance, cinema or visual art. I'm reminded of Mark Kozelek (Red House Painters) and Neil Halstead (Mojave 3) in his delicate approach to songwriting. <strong>A-Side \"A Day at the Firelakes\"</strong> is a magnificent introduction Gould's art. There's a space to it, even an emptiness. Originally written as the title track for an unpublished album, this is its first official release. <strong>Sam Crawford</strong> and <strong>Megan Gould</strong> join Zeb on piano and violin, and float atop the song with restrained melodic figures that quietly enforce harmonic ideas outlined by Gould's vocals. His style of singing is characteristically fragile, and its pleasantly nasal tone achieves in a single voice the kind of balance between strength and quietude that's normally achieved by a male/female duo singing in harmony. I've been told that music has the ability to \"transport\" the listener in an almost literal sense, but I've never fully felt this to be true until I heard \"A Day at the Firelakes\". It's impossible for me to get past the first piano note without being sucked into the world of song that Gould's meticulously constructed. I find myself going back, again and again, just to enter this space and revel in it. It gives me a kind of peace above and beyond any rational musical explanation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Side B \"The Theft of Light\" </strong>was written specifically for this 7-inch, with the thought in mind that it should both contrast with and compliment <strong>\"A Day at the Firelakes\"</strong>. <strong>Gould </strong>pulled the title from a Tsimshian Indian tale explaining the origins of daylight. He recalls, <em>\"I was struck by the phrase and it seemed, in some intangible way, to fit with the music, so I put the two together.\" </em>As much as Gould owes a debt of influence to the various fingerstyle guitarsmiths that have come before him, his approach to the genre is entirely refreshing. Though he's kind enough to orient listeners with an open bass note every 8 beats or so, his picking pattern on \"The Theft of Light\" is deftly syncopated, and gives one the feeling of being propelled through the song, carried atop a wave of sound. While his predecessors have drawn largely on the American tradition of blues and folk for compositional inspiration, Gould's songs are inflected with an almost Balkan harmonic influence, which I suspect might actually be Persian, drawn from his work with the Monika Jalili ensemble. The syncopation reminds me of an Irish reel that's been cut adrift without its foor-on-the-floor backbeat, and there are undoubtedly further global influences at work here that I can't even begin to grasp. Meanwhile, the 12 string guitar is producing so much sound, and with such a rich intensity, that as a listener I'm inclined to ignore the usual considerations of melody, harmony, and rhythm in favor of a broad appreciation of the song's intricate texture.\r\n\r\n<strong>Gould's</strong> music has universal appeal. That's not to say that it's universally liked, but rather that it's universally likable. There's something about it that wholly transcends its roots in American traditional genres and communicates successfully in a language that need not be translated into any other for one to immediately grasp its poignant and beautiful essence. Ampeater's readers include citizens of Iran, New Zealand, Malaysia, Albania, Iceland, Estonia, and Turkey. To all of you around the globe, I'm honored to serve as the musical ambassador to Zeb Gould. I hope his music works its way into your thoughts the way it did mine, and brings you the same lasting joy.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - A Day at the Firelakes [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM132 Zeb Gould/01 A Day at the Firelakes.mp3|titles=A Day at the Firelakes|artists=Zeb Gould]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - The Theft of Light [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM132 Zeb Gould/02 The Theft of Light.mp3|titles=The Theft of Light|artists=Zeb Gould]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM132 Zeb Gould.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Put off by such indiscrete psychoanalysis, I dismissed her comment, and within a month we had parted ways, despite the fact that my exams and any anxiety they had allegedly provoked were already behind me. I recalled my ex-girlfriendâ€™s words recently, though, as I scoured hundreds of recordings in search of the handful that would become the inaugural <strong>Concrete Experience Digital Mixtape</strong>.\r\n\r\nMy ex-girlfriend studied Comparative Literature; a detail which I failed to appreciate at the time but now seems enormously consequential. If she had preferred linear algebra to poetry, her notion of transposition may have involved points and axes rather than romance. Had she studied music, she may have conceptualized it as a fixed-interval melodic shift. Of the countless ways to define transposition, some are inherently more malleable than others. In retrospect, my ex-girlfriendâ€™s indiscreet psychoanalysis was a blessing in disguise, because it pushed me to approach the theme from a principally emotional angleâ€”had I decided to write about fixed-interval melodic shifts, I would have already run out of things to say. Moreover, it prompted me to evaluate the moral implications. Perhaps I really did transpose my anxiety but, so what? Whatâ€™s so bad about transposition?\r\n\r\nYeats muses, <em>â€œHow can we know the dancer from the dance?â€</em> Along the same lines of inquiry, we may question whether music could exist without the musicianâ€”or for that matter, if it could exist without the listener. Practically speaking, I propose that it could not, just as we neednâ€™t pay taxes on the imaginary number <em>i</em>. A somewhat more prosaic metaphor may be the famous conundrumâ€”<em>when a tree falls in the forest and thereâ€™s nobody around to hear it, does it make a sound</em>?â€”for which the only reasonable conclusion is <em>who the fuck cares?</em> Music unheard bears no relevance to humanity. By this standard, all <em>relevant</em> music must involve the listener and becomes, ergo, an act of transposition. So, why these ten tracks?\r\n\r\nThe mix is intended to stand on merit of the music alone, with its ten diverse tracks offering something for everyone. The relationship between the individual songs, however, as well as the relationship between the songs and the theme, is a little more abstract.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s begin with <strong>\"Alain Delon\"</strong>, a humorous and totally groovy exploration of an impossible dream. <em>â€œI canâ€™t take it,â€</em> whines <strong>Francois Peglau</strong> in the opening lyric. <em>â€œIâ€™ll never be Alain Delon.â€ </em>Heâ€™s referring to the star of vintage French cinema known for his memorable of role as <em>le solitaireâ€”</em>a suave, handsome and brooding anti-villain. Conceptually, Peglauâ€™s wish is easy to relate to, since nearly everybody has hoped to become a star. However, as the song unfolds, we sense a hint of sarcasm, and are drawn to question whether the true idol is the man or the character. The tension escalates in the bridge (if you can understand French) with sound clips from a 1970s interview in which the aging actor explains his recurring role. Does an actor stepping into character signify an act of transposition? If so, we must speculate about the agency involved. In other words, does the man become the character or does the character become the man? Who is the real Alain Delon, or has he ceased to exist?\r\n\r\nOf course, the notation of identity is complicated for actors and non-actors alike, perhaps especially so for someone like <strong>Peglau</strong>, who describes himself as Peruvian/French/Argentinean. He began his career as guitarist of Lima-based indie phenomenon <strong>Los Fuckinâ€™ Sombreros</strong>, but now resides in London where he recently recorded a solo album. I mention this not tangentially, but to point out that Peglau, so to speak, wears many hats, a trait shared by several artists on this mix. <strong>Ashraya Gupta</strong> was born in India and lived in England and Cincinnati before winding up in New York. <strong>Jean-Rene Ella </strong>was born and raised in Cameroon but eventually made his way to Indiana where, most improbably, he now works as an organic chemist. Of course, a compelling background does not necessarily lead to good transpositionâ€”nor does good transposition necessarily lead to good musicâ€”but it certainly gives the artist inspiration to draw upon.\r\n\r\nAlthough <strong>Gupta</strong>â€™s international background is not immediately evident in this small sample of her work, the process of continually reinventing herself has left indelible marks on her music. This is clear when you look at her artistic progression. Sheâ€™s best known as singer of <strong>The Kitchen Cabinet</strong>, an indie folk-pop quartet, yet her solo music represents a significant and bold leap for Gupta, who manages to forge new aural ground with just a keyboard and her own vocal chords. Gabe Birnbaum, who profiled Gupta back in October 2009, observed that <em>â€œthough this barebones set-up could prove monotonous or boring in anotherâ€™s hands, Gupta carries [the music] with her voice alone.â€ </em>Even though her vocals are relatively low in the mix, the intimacy of Gupta's delivery and her sparse harmonic arrangements make them seem extremely close, as if weâ€™re listening to her singing to herself alone in her apartment. The music, which occasionally swells to high volumes, unfolds so organically and hypnotically that weâ€™re only aware of these ebbs and flows peripherally.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve never heard a more authentic blues recording than <strong>Ella</strong>â€™s rendition of <strong>â€œWade in the Waterâ€</strong>â€”a bold claim to make of any song but particularly of one released on YouTube in the site's fledgling years. The song's charm lies in its un-indulgent simplicity and emotional honesty. Anyone whoâ€™s picked up an electric guitar understands the seductive allure of the three-chord twelve-bar blues. It practically begs for gratuitous shred-solos. As a result, many blues musicians are no more tasteful than the average 80's hair bandâ€”and considerably less entertaining. People tend to think of the blues as an American archetype, like baseball or apple pie, but we must remember that the ingredients are considerably more diverseâ€”African rhythms and European harmonic conventions baptized in the holy water of the muddy Mississippi. That Ella made the transatlantic journey himself may explain his authenticity. His parents also played a role.Â  Ellaâ€™s French-born mother introduced him to the folk music of her country while his father got him hooked on Gospel. When Ella sings the blues, it is a personal history, a heritage, that he's tapping into. Organic chemistry may not be terribly relevant, but it indicates a lot about Ellaâ€™s lifestyle. Heâ€™s not famous, nor does he seem to aspire to stardom. We wouldnâ€™t have heard from him at all were it not for a series of homemade videos on YouTube, which he posted only after encouragement from friends.\r\n\r\nTo return to <strong>Peglau</strong>, it is worth noting that his personal history has influenced not just his musical or lyrical content, but the very code in which it is written. His recent songs are in English. For anyone who grew up in an English speaking country, this fact may seem insignificant, but for Peglau, who used to write more in Spanish or French, it involved conscious effort. Peglau explains that, when he first arrived in London, he was uncomfortable with the language, and used songwriting as a way to increase his fluency. Is translation also a form of transposition?\r\n\r\nWe might expect a band called <strong>Translations</strong> to shed light on this matter. Indeed, they do, although the type of translation they employ has nothing to do with language. Ben Heller touched upon this dichotomy in his original Ampeater write-up of the band in June 2010: â€œ<em>Translations are acutely aware of their place in history, even before that place has been culturally affirmed by more than a small handful of fans and critics.â€</em> In other words, Translations is a band that can tell us not only where theyâ€™re going, but also where theyâ€™ve been, and with remarkable accuracy. They manage to sound both cutting edge and retro at once, with crunchy punk-era guitars offset by electronicsâ€”surprisingly premeditated for a band whose attitude and exuberance might suggest a singular focus on rocking out. In spite of the hidden self-awareness, though, Heller notes that the members of Translations place their music at <em>â€œdifferent crossroads on the map of New York rock &amp; roll.â€ </em>This highlights just how much personal leeway the act of translation involves, and might explain why Google Translate is still searching for the perfect algorithm.\r\n\r\nIn fact, genre transpositionâ€”the re-contextualization of diverse and often archaic influencesâ€”is a dominant theme on this mix. The process becomes particularly clear in cover songs, such as <strong>â€œSatellite of Loveâ€</strong> by <strong>Color of Clouds</strong>, since itâ€™s easier to spot points of alteration. In this instance, singer <strong>Kelli Scarr's</strong> airy vocals and the song's extended final chorus transforms Lou Reedâ€™s embittered original into a dreamy fantasy. <strong>â€œWe Are the Huntersâ€</strong> by <strong>The D'Urbervilles</strong> and <strong>â€œFor Sparrowâ€</strong> by <strong>Cabinet of Natural Curiosities</strong>, while not covers, also fall under this general mode of transposition. In contrast to the deliberate consciousness that sets <strong>Translations</strong> apart, <strong>Extra Life</strong> takes a more holistic approach in <strong>â€œI Donâ€™t See It That Wayâ€</strong>, borrowing from metal, medieval folk and math-rock. If youâ€™re wondering how such diverse influences can coexist peacefully in a single song, they donâ€™t. Jolting between time signatures, itâ€™s rhythmically so unpredictable that youâ€™d have a hard time finding something to tap your foot to, let along dance to, but if you just let it sweep you around, youâ€™ll get an interesting ride. The song constantly seems to be waging war on itself to the extent that you wonder if the band is even in control of what happens.Â  Of course, they must be, as the parts are so complex that it must have taken a lot of rehearsal.Â  Yet, Jake Brunner, who penned Ampeaterâ€™s post on the band in October 2009, notes that frontman Charlie Lookerâ€™s manipulation of musical material <em>â€œgoes far beyond the look-what-I-can-do aesthetic of many similarly technically proficient musicians,â€ </em>and that his compositional process lets <em>â€œthe notes tell him â€¦ the rhythmic organization, as opposed to entering the creative zone with a preconceived idea of which moves to employ.â€</em>\r\n\r\nWith <strong>Uncles</strong>, this manipulation is both musical and lyrical. I was skeptical when I first heard New York native <strong>Dan Bateman's</strong> thick southern accent which, suspiciously, is present only when he sings. It turns out, though, that thereâ€™s a natural explanation. As a child, Bateman often visited his uncle in Alabama, who introduced him to music by singing to him in that same thick drawl. Eventually, Bateman took these songs back to New York and collaborated with <strong>Will Schwartz</strong> to create Uncles (so named in homage to his Alabama kin, one assumes). Yet Uncles is not ashamed of its urban roots and the duoâ€™s lyricsâ€”ranging from profound to profaneâ€”sound a lot more like Jack Kerouac than anything Batemanâ€™s uncle might have sung. <strong>â€œReplacing Words with Other Words,â€</strong> the title of Unclesâ€™ latest album, alludes to this juxtaposition. The music brings separate worlds together and seeks to reconcile them, such that we walk away from it with a heightened perspective of each. When I think of settlers, I imagine Plymouth Rock, the Oregon Trail, or something similarly obsolete in this world yet <strong>â€œSettlerâ€™s Songâ€</strong> addresses settlers of a different sort, finding poetry in the urban grit and poverty of the immigrantâ€™s New York. Above a sentimental guitar figure and warbling synth, Bateman sings:\r\n\r\n<em>Cracked and torn\r\nFaces scorn\r\nDominicans sipping 40 ounces\r\nSitting bent up on the metal grate on the nail salon\r\nI want to hear my shit pumping\r\nfrom an SUV down a side street bend\r\nOr on the lips of obese women\r\nYakkity yakking in the supermarket</em>\r\n\r\nIâ€™m reminded of a pivotal moment in Milan Kunderaâ€™s <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Unbearable Lightness of Being</span> when a European discusses the beauty of New York. <em>â€œBeauty in the European sense has always had a premeditated quality to it,â€</em> observes the novel's protagonist.Â  <em>â€œThe beauty of New York rests on a completely different base. Its unintentionalâ€¦ Forms which are in themselves quite ugly turn up fortuitously, without design, in such incredible surroundings that they sparkle with a sudden wondrous poetry.â€</em> His lover, an artist, cryptically suggests that such unintentional beauty is the final phase in the history of beauty. What does â€œfinalâ€ imply? Do we infer that it signifies the demise of beauty, or the pinnacle, or both?\r\n\r\nEither way, itâ€™s easy to see why such an unintentional art is the most resilient, as it requires no motive. Perhaps, after all, music <em>can</em> exist without the musician. Without the musician, however, the listener becomes responsible for recognizing music in the honking of horns or the pelting of the rain against the windowpane. We might even say that the listener becomes the musician, just as practitioners of found art are called artists. Oscar Wilde's Vivian attests to this in the author's 1891 essay, â€œThe Decay of Lying:â€\r\n\r\n<em>To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing. One does not see anything until one sees its beauty. Thenâ€”and then onlyâ€”does it come into existence. At present, people see fogs, not because there are fogs, but because poets and painters have taught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects. There may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them. They did not exist till Art had invented them.</em>\r\n\r\nIt seems the process of transposition is reversed in unintentional art, for instead of converting intangible experience into art, weâ€™re taking existing forms and converting them into emotion. Plato banished artists from his utopian Republic on the pretext that representation dilutes an ideal. He was talking about intentional art, yet I suspect that he would have been even more critical of unintentional art, for if intentional art obscures an ideal, unintentional art doesn't even attempt to relate to an ideal. Plato seems to have viewed art as a photocopy, where each successive copy is fainter than the last, until finally the page is blank. What he doesnâ€™t account for is what we add, and our additions are often unintended.Â  Alvin Lucierâ€™s seminal sound experiment â€œI am sitting in a roomâ€ demonstrates the failure of the copy machine metaphor. He records his voice and plays it back into the room which he records and replays again, repeating this process <em>ad infinitum</em> (or so it seems, the total work is about 45 minutes long).Â  His voice is quickly warped, morphing into the resonant frequencies of the room, creating a haunting ambient soundscape rather than silence.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the last track on the mix is a remix that revels in a glitch. The original song, Jay Z's <strong>â€œEmpire State of Mind,â€ </strong>is one that everyone is familiar with, unless you've been living under a rock for the past two years. What we may not have noticedâ€”I myself did not until Ben Lasman's August 2010 review drew my attention to itâ€”is the miniscule glitch that occurs at the 21-second mark in and repeats every so often afterwardsâ€¦ <strong>Blissed Out</strong>'s remix, â€œEmpire State of Mind Edit,â€ is the magnification of that glitch to extreme heights. Of course, Blissed Out is quite aware of what theyâ€™re doing and, as Lasman surmises, so was Jay-Z.\r\n\r\n<em>Itâ€™s a strange little imperfection to find in a more or less immaculately constructed pop song. Something ostensibly unrelated to musicianship or writing, but still too much there to be considered an oversight. Every ten seconds or so it pops up out of nowhere, grinding at the gears of the chorus, tearing the whole jam apart from the inside out like an armful of bot fly babies â€¦ Rap is quite a bit different today than it was a decade ago, sure, but where most heads like to whine about the lyrical transition from the socially-conscious to the fiscally-conservative, itâ€™s also important to note how that thematic shift has been mirrored in the genreâ€™s musical methodology. Sampling, record scratching, the infinite repetition of a breakbeat were all transcendent sonic malfunctions, punk gestures stemming from the same kind of technological anti-humanism as playing slide guitar with a lead pipe or cutting up your torso with a bunch of broken beer bottles thrown hatefully at the stage ... Which is why, when Hovaâ€™s biggest hit in years comes accidentally equipped with incessant, intrusive noisiness, we not only get a throwback to the auto-destructing golden years of rap, but an exciting insight into how this sort of musical antagonism could pop a hole in hip-hopâ€™s fat-suit.</em>\r\n\r\nBut if thatâ€™s so, weâ€™re treading into another phase of beauty that Kunderaâ€™s couple did not imagine, since this is the deliberate representation of unintentional beauty. And so, with each successive layer of transposition we vacillate between the tangible and intangible, the real and imagined, and somewhere in the midst of all of this a complete picture begins to emerge.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for my girlfriend, her accusation backfired. Rather than seeking to appease her, in the following week I grew even more concerned about the upcoming exam. Perhaps Iâ€™d flipped the switch, and had begun to transpose my romantic worries onto academics. More likely, though, I just resented her for making me so self conscious about it all, which is why I urge you to push everything youâ€™ve just read to the back of your mind and give the tracks a relaxed listen.\r\n\r\n<em>CONCRETE EXPERIENCE is a new journal of contemporary photography and creative art published quarterly and based in Seoul, South Korea committed to delivering an engaging alternative to standard art and literature periodicals to creative-minded audiences.

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"peopling\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/peopling-live-pic-300x297.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\" />The relationship between rock music and straight up terrible noise is a long and complicated one, punctuated equally by periods of domestic tranquility (Sonic Youthâ€™s easy-listening records), malicious abuse (Metal Machine Music and its descendants), and toothless hypocrisy (remember Test Icicles?). Like in any loversâ€™ quarrel, outsiders tend to draw lines in the sand: some people like their chord changes neatly separated from their feedback freakouts (sometimes even, they like feedback freakouts over chord changes), while others come to realize that they never liked the noisier stuff to begin with, even though they feel guilty enough about their tenuous allegiances to talk up the experimental tendencies of bands like Animal Collective with something approaching seriousness. Finally, there are people who felt that rock music had become bloated and disingenuous with its increasing lip service to the avant-garde, a mongrel artistic commodity aimed at weekend warriors and self-hating yuppies who claimed to love the Velvet Underground but invariably left the room about four minutes into â€œSister Ray.â€ These people, to borrow a term from Lester Bangs, albeit in a slightly different context, could be called â€œWhite Noise Supremacists.â€ These were individuals who, on the one hand, had developed over the course of decades exposed to pop radio and concept albums an ideological revulsion to all things melodic, rhythmic, and marketable, and, on the other, had suffered enough actual brain damage in the process to enjoy aesthetically the sound of vacuum cleaners and police sirens howling in the dark, wet urban night. Somewhere along the line, this groupâ€™s wiring had gotten disconnected from the mass-cultural mainframe and found itself channeling the random and nihilistic ambience of real life.\r\n\r\nListening to <strong>A-side â€œcome home eccentricâ€</strong> off <strong>peoplingâ€™s</strong> self-titled EP is a bit like receiving a stray transmission from the ambivalent midpoint of this self-alienating process, its origin about equidistant from the poles of â€œfunâ€ and â€œnot fun.â€ Thereâ€™s a confessional quality to the trackâ€™s stylistic indecisiveness, a kind of emo music for people with no feelings whatsoever. Letâ€™s describe the thing: what we hear first is the static blast of a shortwave radio between signals, reaching out hopefully to the shadow-world of long-haul truckers and emergency responders. Then we get a two note bassline burbling up like primordial tar underneath the whole thing. If this was a Spaceman 3 record, all youâ€™d need to add at this point would be some stiff-lipped Brit moaning about Jesus and hey, six minutes later, youâ€™ve got your single in the bag. But <strong>peopling</strong> isn't really about tribute in any normal sense, and so, about one and a half minutes into the jam thereâ€™s an abrupt switch into blurt-y, shout-along synth-pop not completely unlike an under-circulated Screamerâ€™s bootleg. The effect of this transition is comparable to stabbing an RCA cable repeatedly into the broken input on your iPod, only to have the thing connect half-way through the song and at way to high too high a volume. Itâ€™s really pretty awesome, not only because of the visceral thrill of hearing drums and bass and synthesizers and human voices after all that hissing, but also because of the crippling sense of shame you feel for having secretly wanted this kind of thing to happen all along. â€œPlease, turn into an actual song,â€ whispers your lizard brain, while the higher cortexes that control things like art appreciation and pretentiousness shake their heads like a disappointed girlfriend. The song part of the song continues for about two minutes more before being enveloped once more in crackle and hum. As far as outbursts go, itâ€™s up there with screaming â€œFreebird!â€ at a Merzbow performance.\r\n\r\nThe kind of raw self-consciousness at work on this track is rare in any genre, especially one as dehumanizing and purist as power electronics. Since itâ€™s impossible to listen to Whitehouse albums for actual enjoyment, those who find themselves attracted to noise for whatever reason have to develop rock-solid ideologies to support their counterintuitive fandom. These beliefs run the gamut from garden variety suburban listlessness to an extreme willingness to ingest psychedelic drugs. Whatever the pretext, the point is that the genre always operates in relation to some kind of contrarian rationale, feeding the listenerâ€™s urge to become more and more like the non-person he or she wishes so hard to be. Cueing up noise is probably the closest music nerds get to self-actualization, scarifying themselves into iconoclastic ubermenschen through a pair of headphones and the comfort of a bean bag chair. <strong>peopling</strong> latches onto the latent hypocrisy of these self-flagellating gestures with a unique courage, twisting the deadened headspace of their target audience into something that is equal parts satire and introspection. It has the same humor as a soul-shattering gulag joke.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œsummer such and such,â€</strong> the slighter, shorter <strong>B-side</strong> to â€œcome home eccentricâ€ works along similarly critical lines, opting to dispense with the cathartic midsection of its sister track in favor of sheer anxiety. A pretty bedroom pop song buried within an echo chamber of squeaks and burps, the piece ends before any resolution can take place. At one minute and fifty four seconds, about the length of time â€œcome homeâ€ takes before shooting its payload, you can read the cutoff as an intentional blue-balling. In the notes <strong>peopling </strong>contributed to us with his music, he calls this track â€œheartbreaking.â€ Iâ€™d call it simply cruel.\r\n\r\nBeing a white noise ideologue is admirable, in some sense, but also myopic. Back in the half-formed prehistory of garage rock, bands made noisy recordings filled with feedback and garbage acoustics by accident. Eventually, some people began to find these technological imperfections more interesting than the three-chord bash-alongs they helped preserve. Noise, at a certain point, became an intentional choice rather than an understandable mistake. Now a symbolic referent to the conditions that created rock music rather than the crap side-effects that prevented an ideal incarnation of â€œLouie Louieâ€ ever being produced, noise became more than an instrument like a guitar or a saxophone; it became an idea, something to believe in. What came next is well-preserved in record store geology: no-wave, Japanoise, Throbbing Gristle, Darkthrone, glitch. Subgenres became defined by their level of audio fidelity, the amount of time on a record dedicated exclusively to found sounds and ring modulators, the degree to which static blasts of varying textures and pitches could be constructed into recognizable verses and choruses. <strong>peopling </strong>looks at this contrived landscape and hold up the mirror, documentary-style, crafting two-to-five-minute studies into the personal effects of prolonged exposure to stuff most sane people would never want to understand. Even psychopaths need to be analyzed every now and again. All you goners, itâ€™s time to meet your shrinks.\r\n\r\n<strong>peopling</strong> is the solo noise project of Ronnie Gonzalez. He records and lives in NYC. These tracks are from his self-released six-song EP, <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/store/downloads/peopling-ep\">available for sale now through Ampeater Music</a>, and coming soon on iTunes.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Lasman</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - come home eccentric [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM133 peopling/01 come home eccentric.mp3|titles=come home eccentric|artists=peopling]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - summer such and such [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM133 peopling/02 summer such and such.mp3|titles=summer such and such|artists=peopling]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM133 peopling.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Plus, our original reviews are generally so exhaustive that there's usually not much more we can say about a band without beginning to repeat ourselves, or resorting to childhood anecdotes. But, we do love the artists that we feature, and we'd like to continue to help get the word out about their music, long after the original 7-inch review's been buried in the archives. So, we've come up with this: a <strong>Follow-Up 7-inch Series</strong>. We invite any artist that's received a previous review to get back in touch and hit us up with two new tracks. We'll do a shorter write-up, basically updating everyone on any new artistic developments, tours, etc., and giving some context to the new tunes. We'll also link back to the original review, and give it a chance to reach some new listeners. Sound good?

Yet, even in direct allusion to these numerous traditions, the band refuses to buy into any one of them wholesale.Â  Always, I sense a process that involves the extraction of the best features from these genres and their rearrangement into new shapes.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-Side â€œBe My Baby Mamaâ€</strong> challenges the conventions of pop composition, but rests upon such stable foundations that a casual listener might not even notice that anything is amiss.Â  Harmonic and melodic simplicity obscure the underlying innovation.Â  Â The tune begins with a three-chord progression which seems bound to spark a sense of deja ecoutÃ©.Â  The first two chords are rock staples, while the third chord is the predictably-unpredictable heartbreak chord.Â  The rhythm hints at R&amp;B a bit too obviously.Â  When the vocals enter, we perceive a verse.Â  When the drums kick into full throttle and the distortion thickens, we perceive a chorus.Â  A catchy vocal hookâ€”accentuated by all the right harmoniesâ€”confirms our suspicions.Â  But all the evidence proves deceptive.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œBe My Baby Mamaâ€</strong> does not return to the sections we instinctively perceive as verse and chorus and, thus, we can not appropriately label them as such, though still we cannot conceive them in any other way.Â  The tune veers into an extended outro full of compositional twists that, cumulatively, reveal epic grandeur.Â  The momentum builds as harmonies are layered below the lead vocal line. Â It continues to mount with the auxiliary support of a soaring electric guitar solo.Â  Finally the parts converge on the refrain, of which the climax is marked by piercing falsettos.Â  However, having reached this mighty summit, <strong>Quiet Loudly</strong> refuses to take the scenic route back to base.Â  Instead they skydiveâ€”forgive the continuation of this cheesy metaphorâ€”with an unexpected a capella breakdown that proves to be the coup-de-grace to our clichÃ© expectations.Â  As with most of the tricks in Quiet Loudlyâ€™s arsenal, the a capella breakdown is not inherently unprecedented.Â  However, it is completely re-contextualized and rarelyâ€”I feel compelled to addâ€”has it been implemented to such delightful effect in any context.\r\n\r\nBreakdowns of this sort are a risky venture.Â  At their best, they may leave the listener awestruck. Â <em>â€œHow the fuck did they think of that?â€</em> More often, however, they undermine the whole composition and leave the listener confused and disappointed.Â  <em>â€œWhat the fuck were they thinking?â€ </em> The line between these diametrically opposed outcomes is actually vaguer than one might suspect, but it seems indisputable that <strong>Quiet Loudly</strong> falls on the correct side.Â  To begin with, the breakdown strikes a healthy balance between unexpected and incongruous.Â  I did not anticipate it but, in retrospect, it seems to have been foreshadowed by the layered harmonies which preceded it.Â  Moreover, it lifts the lyrics of the refrain<em>â€”â€œyou could rescue my bloodlineâ€</em>â€”to our attention.Â  The plea casts an additional layer of irony over the satire posed by the raunchy pickup line that the title so convincingly insinuates.Â  For these reasonsâ€”in addition to the sheer precision of its executionâ€”the tune lingered in my memory after a single listen.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œI Would Be Your Manâ€</strong> may seem an unusual choice for a B-Side.Â  From the start, I appreciated the poetic logic of the progression between a tune called <strong>â€œBe My Baby Mamaâ€</strong> and a tune called â€œI Would Be Your Man.â€Â  However, I couldnâ€™t dismiss the itty-bitty technicality that <strong>Quiet Loudly</strong> neither wrote the track nor received principle performance credit.Â  The song was written by <strong>Gunfight</strong>, another Brooklynite outfit whose sound falls within the expansive umbrella of rock but occasionally tests these limits.Â  Quiet Loudly is featured on the track but, on the mp3 they submitted to Ampeater, the id3 tag reads <em>Gunfight</em>.Â  No mention of a feature.Â  I liked the music, but I was a bit perplexed.\r\n\r\nThe missing link proved to be â€œ<strong>Brooklyn Heat</strong>,â€ a compilation curated, engineered, and mixed by <strong>Shane Oâ€™Connor</strong>.Â  Through this initiative, a handful of underappreciated local bandsâ€”whose ranks include both <strong>Quiet Loudly</strong> and <strong>Gunfight</strong>, in addition to previous Ampeater featured artists <strong><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem018\">Shark?</a> </strong>and <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem047\"><strong>Quilty</strong></a>â€”were given the opportunity to cut track at <strong>Monsterland Recording Studio</strong>.Â  (At this point, I canâ€™t resist the urge to give a shoutout for the upcoming <strong>MMNY </strong>Festival at which all these bands are slated to perform on June 21<sup>st</sup>).Â  In fact, Quiet Loudly did lend a hand (several hands?) to the version of â€œI Would Be Your Manâ€ featured on this digital 7-inch.Â  The original recording of â€œI Would Be Your Manâ€ has a prominent folk vibe, with slide guitar and sound effects that seem like they may have come from a spaghetti western.Â  But, in the studio, Gunfight decided that their track would benefit from a large ensemble and turned to Quiet Loudlyâ€”a decision probably influenced in part by the fact that they share a bassist, <strong>Anthony Aquilino</strong>.Â  The result is a rowdy rendition which portrays the energy and urgency of the live show in convenient mp3 format.\r\n\r\nI once believed that I had outgrown my love for scorching guitar solos when I graduated from high-school but â€œ<strong>I Would Be Your Man</strong>â€ forces me to question my assumptions.Â  I now suspect my soft spot did not diminish but was simply shrouded by a thick cloud of skepticism.Â  Actually, the guitar solo is only the tip of the iceberg.Â  The cut is an unabashed rock anthem.Â  Yet it is full of tasteful subtleties that become more evident with repeat listens and which shed a new light on the boisterous excess.Â  Perhaps this is why it penetrates the cloud of skepticism, and calls to me.Â  I also suspect that a healthy dose of excess is prerequisite to the party vibe so convincingly evoked.\r\n\r\nSome music is inherently loud.Â  Some music is not.Â  Heavy metal was made to be blasted.Â  Antonio Carlos Jobim was not.Â  <strong>Quiet Loudly</strong> seems to realize this.Â  The band demonstrates a rare ability to make the calm moments boom, and can find tranquility in the midst of the thickest distortion.Â  Check them out.Â  I hope that youâ€”like the hypothetical iconic rock band, and like meâ€”will find your love for the classic rekindled by their astute and fresh perspective.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A -

Interested readers are encouraged to check out <a title=\"AEM095 The Powder Kegs\" href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem095\">AEM095</a> for more free music and information.</em>\r\n\r\nLast year, <strong>The Powder Kegs</strong> earned our attention with their catchy and energetic cuts <strong>â€œLa Mariposaâ€</strong> and <strong>â€œShake Me Downâ€</strong> on <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem095\">AEM095</a>. Since then, they've refined their sound and have a new album, <strong>The Amanicans</strong>.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the sophomore album is a litmus test. It requires the artist to strike an appropriate balance between old and new and, no matter how artfully he succeeds, the he can expect a certain degree of shit from fans who think he leaned too far in one direction. Indeed, sophomore albums invite criticism. However, if an artist can make it past the sophomore album hurdle without receiving too much shit, we must view this as a mark of considerable success. Indeed, the sophomore album is the key measure by which we may distinguish the bands we really like from the bands we only think we like.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Amanicans</strong> offers much to enjoy and leaves very little to wish for. Moreover, it marks a major step in the artistic development of the band. The new material is darker, heavier, and considerably more substantive than the material on the debut EP, and it draws upon more diverse influences.\r\n\r\nWith pronounced shades of Punk and Brit-Pop, <strong>A-Side â€œBroke Timeâ€ </strong>has the requisite punch to capture the attention of any listener sedated by the previous album's laid-back vibe. Yet these new influences do not seem incongruous;the music retains the salient features that drew us to <strong>The Powder Kegs</strong> in the first place. The tune commences with the artists' characteristic lush falsettos, accompanied by a twangy guitar lick. After a few cycles, the beat drops, satisfying the listener's more visceral audio-needs with a solid foundation upon which the composition unfolds. The crisp bass and drum groove persists throughout several refrains (repetitions of the title lyrics) and verses, offset now and then by a chorus. The mellow half-time feel of the chorus does not threaten to undermine the escalation of the composition, but rather serves as a respite, and each time the verse/refrain reappears, it's rehashed with heightened intensity. The build culminates with a heavy pentatonic riff accentuated by a strong back-beatâ€”an ending that fans of The Powder Kegs' previous material might find abrasive, had we not been eased into it so gradually.\r\n\r\nLike so much of <strong>The Powder Kegs'</strong> material, both new and old, <strong>B-Side â€œThe Seaâ€</strong> is marked by falsetto and harmony. This time, however, those characteristics are re-contextualized against the backdrop of eerie drugged-out lullaby reminiscent of the Beatles during the height of their LSD years. The composition's loping three-beat pulse, occasionally shaken by isolated five-beat measures, adds to the general sense of uneasiness. As the composition builds, the many distinct voices (instruments) within the dystopian dreamscape appear ready to coalesce. And yet, our expectations are never satisfiedâ€”which is precisely what makes this track so satisfying. The triumphant horns that so hopefully buoy the end up from the depths of delusion are ultimately tethered to the seafloor, and leave the listener tantalizingly close to the surface, inches short of harmonic salvation. Cheesy ocean metaphors aside, â€œThe Seaâ€ represents a bold departure for a band I so recently praisedâ€”but nearly wrote offâ€”as accessible.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Powder Kegs do remain accessible, but <strong>The Amanicans</strong> demonstrates a slight penchant for the experimental that I wouldn't have necessarily anticipated from the band I wrote up just last year. They've taken a few risksâ€”enough to maintain our interest without fucking up the original recipeâ€”and it really shows.\r\n\r\n<em>If you like what you hear, The Amanicans may be purchased atÂ <a href=\"http://www.music.thepowderkegs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">music.thepowderkegs.com</a>.Â  Now you can pat yourself on the back for supporting starving independent artists and also for having impeccable taste!</em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Broke Time [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM095-1 The Powder Kegs/01 Broke Time.mp3|titles=Broke Time|artists=The Powder Kegs]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - The Sea [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM095-1 The Powder Kegs/02 The Sea.mp3|titles=The Sea|artists=The Powder Kegs]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM095-1 The Powder Kegs.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

For those of you who keep copies of this list in triplicate on your desks, just go right ahead and add Boston's <strong>Thick Shakes</strong> to the top. Though they cruise on a road paved with discarded Nuggets compilations, they approach the mess of American garage rock with a remarkably refined aesthetic that brings a measure of control and sanity to a style of music that otherwise tends to run completely off the rails. At their core, these are songs made for dingy basement clubs, by dudes who don't own cases for their instruments and drummers who make do with two broken floor toms and a cymbal made from soup cans and duct tape. The standard of musicianship is traditionally low, dominated by repetitive four chord riffs, half-sung/half-shouted unison vocal lines, and endless moments of disjointed slop. But that's more a personal impression than a real assessment, and each band has its own particular swagger. The Monks tend to be on the experimental side, The Gories on the punk/slop side, and The Detroit Cobras on the motown/soul side. That said, the Venn diagram of their respective approaches to music is almost all overlap, and Thick Shakes are right smack dab in the middle. To anyone who's spent weeks in their underwear listening to the Nuggets and Pebbles discs on repeat: Thick Shakes will be your new favorite band.\r\n\r\nThere's something about organ (and I mean real organ, not this silly synth shit), that gets me off my ass in an instant. It's like an invisible call to arms, a post-hypnotic suggestion that I must immediately rock the fuck out. Combined with driving snare hits on 2+4, some seriously blown-out guitar, and infallibly punchy vocals, this is music to dance to, to sweat to, to take amphetamines and freak out to. As <strong>Thick Shakes </strong>guitarist <strong>Tim Scholl</strong> explains, it's <em>\"American R&amp;B and blues, filtered through young British kids back into young Americans.\" </em>Generations of disaffected youth channeling each others' music across the pond and claiming it as their own. To that I'd add that it's also been filtered up a generation, to musicians who have varied tastes in (and unrestricted access to) the full spectrum of American popular music, from folk and country to blues and soul. But this panoramic view of musical history doesn't always produce the best bands. There's a tendency to reach for the stars and try something \"new\", which almost inevitably results in something \"terrible\". When the Rolling Stones set out to make music, their only goal was to be the best blues band in town. They didn't see Exile on Main Street coming down the road, not even close, but as we all know, they eventually grew into something much more than an American blues cover band. It's because that growth happened naturally that they made such a phenomenal contribution to rock and roll.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thick Shakes</strong> has a similar approach to music-making, and it's what distinguishes them from the mass of psychedelically inclined proto-punk garage bands that never quite made it. I get the sense that Thick Shakes isn't trying to do anything special, but that's exactly the attitude that makes them such a treasure. In his thoughts on Thick Shakes, <strong>Scholl</strong> went on to explain that <em>\"'Musicians' </em>(his quotes)<em> have a tendency to add this and that to songs, which can make them interesting, but a lot of times just sort of amounts to wankery. We write the songs, and then work on the proficiency of playing what we've written. We aren't a 'jam band' </em>(again, his quotes)<em>\"</em>. I love that quote. Back when radio hits and 78RPM records demanded a crisp 2:30 per track, concision was a valuable asset in songwriting. We've since conquered the technical limitations that once constrained popular song form, and with an ever-expanding subset of artists who indulge in endless wankery, it's refreshing to hear a band that says what it needs to say and gets the fuck out.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lindsay Crudele</strong>, <strong>Tim Scholl</strong>, <strong>Matt Mafera</strong>, and <strong>Jerry MacDonald</strong> are the brains, voices, and fuzz behind <strong>Thick Shakes</strong>. MacDonald pretty much summed up the band dynamic with one word: fun.<em> \"</em><em>It's fun to get together and do what we want. It's fun to do that in<strong> </strong>front of people. It's fun when people like it. Ultimately we were going to have fun anyway.\"</em> Crudele corroborates, <em>\"Our dynamic feels easy for me because I feel close to the others, insofar as Iâ€™m marrying one of them (Tim) and the others are close friends. Learning to play and sing, and do it in front of people all seemed like an insurmountable mystery, so to be able to pull it off to whatever degree is a lot of fun, and then to do it with people I enjoy. The songs are like the intersection of nonsense party music with a bunch of vexation.\" </em>As much as I appreciate the barely-of-this-world-tortured-artist, I'm infinitely more impressed when seemingly stable, functioning human beings enjoy life so fully that their cup spills over and floods their music with a genuine passion.\r\n\r\nAs a native Bostonian living in enemy territory, I'm naturally fond of songs that shit on Boston's numerous detractors. <strong>A-Side \"Go Back to New York\"</strong> is a playful jab at transplant Bostonians who bitch about America's finest city. Sure, the bars close at 1am when the trains stop running, the winters are cold and bitter, cars aim to kill pedestrians rather than avoid them, and the entire city possesses an almost cultish enthusiasm for the Red Sox (so sue me, I bought a Sox license plate), but <strong>Thick Shakes</strong> make a good point: You live here, right? Stop complaining, or leave. Go back to New York, asshole.\r\n\r\nThe musical recipe is simple to describe but tough to follow:\r\n1) Find a hook\r\n2) Build a song around the hook\r\n3) Pick an uncomplicated topic or situation, and describe it\r\n4) Make music\r\n\r\nOf course, there are other essential ingredients to this mix (I already mentioned the ass-thumping organ), and the first that comes to mind is the phenomenal voice of <strong>Lindsay Crudele</strong>. Fans of Erika Wennerstrom and the Heartless Bastards or Rachel Nagy and The Detroit Cobras will feel right at home with Crudele's assertive alto. Maybe it's that I'm somewhat used to hearing female lead singers, but it didn't even occur to me until I spoke with Crudele that there are more Mick Jaggers in the world than Poly Styrenes, and that rock music isn't exactly an encouraged career path for talented young women. Crudele recalls, <em>\"</em><em>I went to shows all the time throughout high school and college in addition to dabbling in instruments. After I graduated, my coworker in radio, an engineer and musician named Bob C., asked me why I didnâ€™t play in a band myself, told me that I should and that I could, and I didnâ€™t have a good answer. I felt like there was a wall between the stage and me, I thought playing in a band was some magical privilege and it didnâ€™t occur to me to try it for myself. I also didnâ€™t see very many female faces up there or at shows in general, where I was used to watching from the back of the club because the front was too violent. In 2011, I donâ€™t think much has changed. At a recent show, the only time I got up to the front was when I was performing onstage. A sound guy recently tried to show me how to turn on my own amp. I spoke up about how a lot of my music scene peers were supporting some really misogynistic music and I was told to get a sense of humor. We played a show where I was the only woman onstage all night and Tim pointed out that wasnâ€™t entirely true - there were naked women painted on the drum kit. Anyone can start a band but it took a while to open my eyes to that I think in part due to the climate. A few years later, I emailed Bob our recordings and was like, 'This is your fault!' That kind of encouragement should not be understated.\" </em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Thick Shakes</strong> strike a careful balance between a fullness of sound and a minimalistic approach to music making. The natural distortion in the recordings on this 7-inch is the result of meticulous planning -- both tracks were recorded with vintage mics and preamps to 16 track tape with hot levels and some tape delay and reverb added to the mix. It's an analog approach to recording that we're sending to shit with a digital 7-inch, so do yourselves a favor and pick up the real thing at <a href=\"http://www.aurora7.com/order.html\">Aurora7</a>. It's just $6 and goes to support some great music. <strong>B-side \"Neighbor's Goods\"</strong> has the percussive groove of The Monks' \"Boys are Boys\" but with the tempo set to stun. Musically, everything slots in perfectly here--memorable hooks and clean fills that don't seek to impress but instead focus on keeping everything rock solid as the song moves forward. The success of Thick Shakes is in the clarity of execution, and the distinction of individual sounds. The vocals, bass, guitar, drums, and organ each inhabit their own space, and have a well defined role within the group dynamic. Sometimes the organ and guitar blend together as a single sound, sometimes the bass and organ do the same, but I get the impression that the group sound at a given moment isn't the result of some happy accident, but rather a rehearsed decision with an effect on listeners that's known and understood by every member of the band. In other words, these guys are really, really tight, and in that respect, they're a world apart from most other bands with a similar sound. Moreover, there's something pejorative about the label of \"Nuggets redux\" that's oh so tempting to slap on Thick Shakes. Nuggets or Pebbles or whatever implies that the artist in question is somehow a shining musical beacon amongst a sea of dreadful schlock. But it's the other way around, really. Blues, punk, rock, and Americana are lost influences these days. It's rare to find a band that's willing to embrace a raw aesthetic and make music that's authentic to their own experiences. So much is lost when creation becomes this distant and cerebral process, but Thick Shakes keep it real. I noticed that almost every member of the band is eager to dismiss his or her own musical talent and training:\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Lindsay:</em></strong><em> Iâ€™m not under any illusion that our band is a means to a living. Music isnâ€™t about business for us. </em>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Tim:</em></strong><em> I've been involved in music one way or another since childhood. If<strong> </strong>not playing or writing, then actively listening, always. I've never played guitar, or really written songs before.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Matt:</em></strong><em> I grew up playing percussion in school bands, I taught myself to play a kit in junior high. I never took either very seriously. Thick Shakes is my first band, and I'm not really sure I would have joined a band under many other circumstances, it was the right mix of good friends with similar abilities.</em>\r\n\r\nThere are no delusions of grandeur here, no lifelong aspirations to play Shea Stadium, just some folks who love music, can play a few instruments, and decided to give it a go. Consider that none of it would have happened if Bob (remember Bob?) hadn't given Lindsay just a little push towards the stage, and it becomes kind of a heartwarming story. And so, we have Bob to thank for the sounds of <strong>Thick Shakes</strong>, and Thick Shakes to thank for the sounds on this 7-inch. Give it a listen, but you might want to stretch beforehand, as dancing is required.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Go Back to New York [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM135 Thick Shakes/01 Go Back to New York.mp3|titles=Go Back to New York|artists=Thick Shakes]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Neighbor's Goods [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM135 Thick Shakes/02 Neighbor's Goods.mp3|titles=Neighbor's Goods|artists=Thick Shakes]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM135 Thick Shakes.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

As I sat there watching, I knew on some level that it was hilarious, but I was nevertheless paralyzed by the realization that this parody spoke to me on a level that it perhaps shouldn't. My bandmate and I seem to reinvent our sound every gig, veering wildly from country to electronic, from rockabilly to black metal, and back again. And I don't think we're the only ones. There are hordes of reasonably competent musicians searching for their \"new sound\", while going great lengths to avoid the common tropes of rock and roll, like a virus that might spread to consume everything in sight, leaving them left with nothing but pentatonic scales and skinny jeans. What they fail to realize is that these bits of musical kitsch are the proverbial building blocks of civilization, and when used in interesting new ways with a bit of creative enthusiasm are infinitely more compelling than whatever <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6aKu60jhec\" target=\"_blank\">noise</a> we might conjure in our attempts to eschew convention. In other words, there's a reason we love pop music--it draws on its own past successes and expands upon them while culling inspiration from an increasingly large and varied pool of influences. We recognize something familiar and comforting in every pop song, even as it pushes the fold of our expectations. At exactly 22 seconds into <strong>Santah's</strong> magnificent <strong>A-Side \"No Other Women,\"</strong> I saw with perfect clarity how decades of rock and roll can ferment into something powerful. This shit's 110 proof, and it blew me clean off my feet.\r\n\r\nI don't know much about Midwestern songsmiths <strong>Santah</strong>, but their 7-inch landed with a splash in the Ampeater submissions box, and I've been entranced by its mix of hook-laden vocal lines and layers of controlled fuzz. <strong>Stanton and Vivian McConnell</strong> double on guitar and vox, with <strong>Tommy Trafton</strong> on keys, <strong>Otto Stuparitz </strong>on bass/vox, and <strong>Steve Plock</strong> on skins. There's a brand of upbeat pop music breaking through the surface of indie gloom, like a gentle hand on the shoulder of the genre, saying <em>\"Hey man, it's gonna be ok. Just dance,\" </em>and Santah's the best of the bunch. I could write an entire review about the first 22 seconds of <strong>A-side \"No Other Women\"</strong>. It's not so much an introduction as a launch mechanism, an entry into the song that proclaims excellence and follows through in bold strides. The predominant sound of this sequence is an ever so slightly distorted guitar tone, supported chordally by the piano and with a percussive emphasis on each downbeat. The main melody is repeated twice, with the last note held, repeated twice more, and then held again while building in preparation for the vocal entrance. The track kicks off with a \"Whoa!\" and proceeds in what's either 12/8 time, 3/4 time with 4 bar groupings, or a very slow 4/4. Hey, it's rock music, who the fuck really cares, but this rhythmic change-up ends up being the predominant feature of the song, and might go largely unnoticed by most listeners. Most really really catchy songs have a single lynchpin decision that makes them so infectious. It's the difference between a great song and one that takes residence in your skull, bouncing around in short little snippets while you go about your business. Truth be told, I've had the Macarena stuck in my head for 17 years. Whether I really want to admit it or not, that's a damn catchy song, but I digress. What carries \"No Other Women\" past the first half minute is Stanton McConnell's resplendent voice. It's young and vibrant in a way that eschews any accusations of frivolity and instead conjures imagery of a life waiting to be lived, with open roads stretching in every direction, tempting you to shoot away for an adventure, leaving gas bills unopened, house abandoned, and pets unfed. I have a tendency to ignore lyrics in songs, half because I can never understand them, and half because I'd rather find my own context. I generally turn to lyrical content when I run out of musical fuel, so it's a compliment of the highest order that I have no idea what McConnell is saying, and don't particularly care. What interests me is the impression a song gives as a whole, and whether that impression is but a sketch of something interesting or an immersive world I can crawl inside for three minutes. Songs like \"No Other Women\" are why iTunes added a repeat-one button--I could leave it on all day, and I actually have on several occasions. When a song starts out with such tremendous momentum, it's always tempting to listen for echoes of the opening in subsequent sections. I'm often tortured by songs that bust out a killer lick just once and then refuse to repeat it in any form, but Santah kindly treats us to a refrain of the intro melody in the vocal line, including the fantastic moment of \"Whoa!\", this time shouted repeatedly and extended to \"Whaowhoaoooo\" and supported in lush harmonies. It's a merciful template for a song, giving us the right hooks in the right proportions, using a composite of familiar recipes to make something new and arguably superior to any of its ingredients.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm met with an A-side that blows me away, I immediately assume the B-side will temper my wildly positive expectations and prove the artist in question to have little or no depth of talent. I begin formulating paragraphs as to how I might excuse the oddball B-side in light of the A-side's marvelous qualities. So, when the B-side turns out to be terrific, I have to step back and revise my game plan. <strong>Santah's B-side \"Neighbors &amp; Cousins\"</strong> is one such shining example. The song unfolds into a vamp at walking speed, powered by a fuzzed guitar strumming eighth notes and an almost tropical bass line set high in the mix. I'm trying to avoid using the word \"sunny\" to describe this song, as it's plastered all over Santah's press material, but there's something about it that's inarguablyâ€¦sighâ€¦\"sunny\". Whether it's the bass hook or the vibrato in the lead guitar tone, something about this song invokes a beach weather mentality that gives this 7-inch a particularly uplifting quality. It's also refreshing to hear a real (or close facsimile of a real) piano tone. In a world in which most anybody can play a few chords on synthesizer and loop it in Ableton, it's nice to hear the percussive thump of piano keys being used to good effect. I feel like I've maybe harped a bit on how conventional and sunny Santah's music might seem, but there's weirdness here too, which is what separates their intelligent song craft from (and elevates it above) the uninspired masses. Take a listen to the breakdown at about 3 minutes in--it's a pretty ballsy move to interrupt a song with so much momentum to introduce a spoken word section over bass, drums, and a dissonant little piano figure. But it works, and instead of killing the song's meticulously crafted vibe, it builds tension leading into the coda and snaps the listener back into the song as it builds to its grand conclusion. I don't mean to infer that this was some careful formula, mapped out on paper long before the song even existed, and that's the danger of writing about music--it's so easy to strip a song down to its bones, and by the time you're done imposing methodologies you've killed whatever magic once existed. I'm sure the origin of the ending tag to \"Neighbors &amp; Cousins\" sounded more like <em>\"Bro, bro, listen, let's just like, do the thing we do earlier, but kinda crazier here, bro\"</em> and less like Adorno dissecting Mozart, but my editors only allow me to say <em>\"bro\"</em> six times per article, and I'd probably exceed my quota if I went this route. In any case, my point is that it's easy to kill good pop music with criticism. It's something that's fundamentally meant to be felt and understood without the need to articulate its various nuances. If it had to be explained, it wouldn't be popular, now would it? Needless to say, this 7-inch requires no explication for maximal enjoyment, so you might want to skip all this drivel, crank your speakers, and hit play on Santah's wonderful 7-inch.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - No Other Women [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM136 Santah/01 No Other Women.mp3|titles=No Other Women|artists=Santah]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Neighbors and Cousins [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM136 Santah/02 Neighbors and Cousins.mp3|titles=Neighbors and Cousins|artists=Santah]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM136 Santah.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

The lyrics spin a beautiful taleâ€”subject matter universal enough that anyone could relate, yet treated with such precision that most listeners will feel drawn to look at their daily grindsÂ  Â Â with heightened awareness.Â  As the story unfolds, Oâ€™Brien subtly introduces the idea of inevitability, an unnamed force that guides our everyday actions.\r\n\r\n<em>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m late.</em>\r\n<em>My dearest one, what can I say?</em>\r\n<em>And tomorrow it could be the same,</em>\r\n<em>When I do it all again.</em>\r\n\r\nThe narrator suggests that his path is not a choice, and does not make excuses for an action, the repetition of which seems destined.Â  Indeed, what can he say?\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œIn The Ridgeâ€</strong> by <strong>Hank &amp; Pigeon</strong> approaches the theme from the same general tack but from somewhat stranger perspectiveâ€”that of a pigeon. Â The pigeon character is a regular character throughout the duoâ€™s work but, in this track, he is introduced.Â  Generally, we donâ€™t read too much into the actions of pigeons.Â  They eat, they shit, and they sleep.Â  After all, weâ€™re talking about an animal with a brain the size of an acorn.Â Â  But here, the pigeons actions take on a new weight, and become a presence far more dear than construction, noisy neighbors, or other more plausible explanations for the strange sound guitarist/vocalist <strong>Alex Wernquest</strong> hears emanating from his apartment walls every day.Â  Actually, itâ€™s unclear whether the lead pigeon is real or imagined.Â  But as a tangible and physical embodiment of the phantom noise, the bird becomes a sort of breathing and feathered ritual.\r\n\r\nPushing our tolerance for absurdity one step further, <strong>The</strong> <strong>Wave Pictures</strong> draws attention to ritual though highly imaginative and bizarre imagery.Â  The sparse aesthetic and simple pop progression of <strong>â€œJust Like A Drummerâ€</strong> leave the listener free to focus on the lyricsâ€”thankfully, since they are both vivid and unusual enough to require our full attention.Â  The first time I tuned in, they washed over me as a nonsensical wave of the whimsical.Â  It was only gradually, that I began to sense that the words relate a more tangible storyline.\r\n\r\n<em>The sun came in like a pack of orange spaniels</em>\r\n<em>Through the window, under the ledge</em>\r\n<em>Under the curtain, on their bellies</em>\r\n<em>Creeping and bending</em>\r\n\r\nWhat is the story behind the words?Â  Well, Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s about sunlightâ€”probably daybreakâ€”creeping through the window.Â  Yet clearly, the point of interest is not the action, but rather the extended metaphor.Â  Thereâ€™s nothing inherently exceptional about sunlight, but here we view it as a pack of orange spaniels (whom I envision to be invertebrate jelly-dogs) snaking over the windowsill.Â  <strong>â€œJust Like A Drummerâ€</strong> is everyday life as seen through the eyes of a genius, a lunatic, or both, under which even an image so clichÃ© as daybreak may thrill and delight. Â Lead singer <strong>David Tattersalâ€™s</strong> desperate whine accentuates the frantic intensity of this unusual mind-frame.Â  Yet , perhaps the true accomplishment of the lyrics is the way in which all the extended metaphors weave together into a semi-coherent tapestry.Â  The story hinges on the refrain, <em>â€œJust like a drummer, I wake up to the thunder, of your typewriter.â€</em> These three phrases suddenly make sense together, just like the motion of a hand from spectacles to testicles, so on, and so forth.Â  But the order is completely bastardized in the extended outro, which implements brilliantly a tactic usually left up to third graders in school districts too poor to afford plastic recordersâ€”the round.Â  In this case, the round consists of a three phrases segment, the peak of one cycle overlapping the trough of another, such that they connect in new and bizarre ways:\r\n\r\n<em>I wake up with the thunder (just like a drummer) </em>\r\n<em>Of your typewriter (wake up with the thunder) </em>\r\n<em>Just like a drummer (Of your typewriter)</em>\r\n\r\nThe mismatched round pairs phrases with echoes that donâ€™t make sense.Â  To compound the chaos, this three phrase repetition is pitted against a four chord progression.Â  What seems like a beginning becomes the middle in the next repetition, the entire refrain cascading into a figurative Ouroborosâ€”the mythical serpent perpetually swallowing his own tail.Â  Itâ€™s no wonder that <strong>Tattersal</strong> canâ€™t help but crack a laugh after a couple of cycles.\r\n\r\nLife is full of rituals, but rarely are these practices so pronouncedâ€”and so taken for grantedâ€”as in music.Â  Of course, every genre has its own specific set of rituals.Â  A pop ballad builds from verse to pre-chorus to chorus, with a bridge inserted after the second or third chorus and, perhaps, a double chorus at the end for dramatic emphasis.Â  A concerto includes three movements, each centered on specific themes and variations.Â  A jazz quartet knows instinctively to play the head, pass around solos, repeat the head, and tag the final four bars to end a tune.Â  Yet such devotion to rituals seems at odds with the creative spirit so crucial to music.Â  Thus, most music seems to strike an appropriate balance between adherence and defiance, a process which we may view as its own ritual.\r\n\r\n<strong>Darlingsideâ€™s â€œMaleaâ€</strong> was written to accompany a dance, and adapted to the rituals which this purpose demanded.Â  The rhythmic focusâ€”from the crisp drum beat to the percussive claps and note skips on the chorusâ€”is a throwback to this intent.Â  These are traditions that go without saying in dance but, in this context, become a spicy and somewhat novel addition to the mix.Â  â€œMaleaâ€ is a bold departure for a band whose sound is generally marked by folksy arrangements and radio perfect vocal harmonies, yet itâ€™s a risk which pays off considerably.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>â€œAdderechâ€</strong>, <strong>Debo Band</strong> draws on numerous traditions but breaks from them all at whim, in the quest for a formidable groove; and it definitely finds what itâ€™s looking for.Â  The band is an amorphous collective of musicians whose eclectic sound spans oceans and centuries. Â Most Western ears will pick up on the Afrobeat (specifically, Ethiopian) influence which, admittedly, is prominent.Â  Yet those familiar with Ethiopian music will not be surprised to learn that the group formed in Boston rather than Addis Ababa, in 2006 rather than 1976.Â  Gabe Birnbaum puts it well in his November, 2009 review on Ampeater.Â  <em>â€œThey manÂ­age to stradÂ­dle a lot of seemÂ­ingly conÂ­traÂ­dicÂ­tory posiÂ­tions. On the one hand, their music is deeply traÂ­diÂ­tional, includÂ­ing a lot of covÂ­ers of Ethiopian Folk and Pop songs from decades ago, yet on the other it is staunchly conÂ­temÂ­poÂ­rary, incorÂ­poÂ­ratÂ­ing origÂ­iÂ­nal comÂ­poÂ­siÂ­tions and traces of the indiÂ­vidÂ­ual memÂ­bers other projects, which range from the draÂ­matic Post-Rock silent-film soundÂ­tracks to danceÂ­hall derived experÂ­iÂ­menÂ­tal EelecÂ­tronÂ­ica.â€</em> The product honors the traditions and values of its diverse influences, without buying into the specific rituals wholesale.Â  Itâ€™s a brew which accommodates the â€œ<em>tautly stretched and rolling time feel that locks in perÂ­fectly with the wonÂ­derÂ­fully twitchy and propulÂ­sive Ethiopian eskista shoulÂ­der dance comÂ­monly perÂ­formed alongÂ­side theÂ music</em>,â€ and yet, creates new rituals and grooves of its own.\r\n\r\n<strong>Pistolea</strong> treads a similar tightrope, meshing Mexican Folk with the Rock, Pop, and Jazz of New York.Â  Itâ€™s a tasteful and energetic foundation, on which songwriter <strong>Sandra Velasquez</strong> preaches soapbox politics.Â  In fact, the music accentuates the political message, which centers on immigration reform and civil rights.Â  In the final lyric of <strong>â€œLa Polica,â€</strong> Velasquez rattles off a list of adjectives that could be usedâ€”by friends and foes alikeâ€”to caricature the band: <em>â€œterrorist, feminist, Mexican, American, condemned, dangerous, PISTOLERA.â€</em> But she says all this in a language which the bigoted system she attacks would be unlikely to understand.Â  Meanwhile, the music cements the bandâ€™s heritage, which lies on both sides of the border, far more viscerally.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Jerome Ellis</strong>â€™s meditative <strong>â€œHymnal,â€ </strong>ritual is again cemented by the music rather than lyrics.Â  In fact, there arenâ€™t so many lyrics to speak of.Â  Like most loop based compositions, â€œHymnalâ€ takes hold of a few simple ideas and explores them meticulouslyâ€”in this case, for nearly thirty minutes.Â  The progression is so gradual that itâ€™s almost indiscernible from one minute to the next, until suddenly itâ€™s shaken beyond recognition.Â  Through such careful rumination and premeditated destruction, the main themes gradually shine.\r\n\r\nOf course, a hymnal is itself a sort of ritual, and the choice of titles cements this ideal, although <strong>Ellis</strong>â€™s take is woven from a far more expansive history of tradition.Â  In fact, I feel as if he takes on the entire history of musicâ€”impossibly vast terrainâ€”as his inspiration, and nearly manages to cover it all.Â  The mysterious drone which slowly swells into a song sounds like the dawn of time.Â  Or, rather, it sounds like the soundtrack to the dawn of time, since obviously primitive musicians didnâ€™t have access to synthesizers.Â  All that's missing is the voice-over narrated by Leonard Nimoy.Â  Soon, a chant emerges from the sci-fi soundscape, accompanied by tribal percussion.Â  It builds toward a saxophone lead, which evokes the stereotypical but universally recognizable pulse of African music, while harking back to Coltraneâ€™s modal compositions or, perhaps, the work of Rahsaan Rolland Kirk. On and on, the history flows.Â  We pass through the European Classical tradition in a few minutes, from blues to jazz, and beyond.Â  Prominent (and often disconcerting) sound effects mark the most dramatic moments. Â The applause of the crowd, for instance, becomes a recurring theme.Â  This itself is a strange ritualâ€”why do we slap our palms together to show respect after a performance and, so often, drown out the final note?\r\n\r\nThe more I contemplate ritual, the less I understand it.Â  In most cases, it seems arbitrary, and yet, so profoundly poetic.Â  Why did Nomar Garciaparra adjust his batting gloves?Â  I imagine he did so because he did it once accidentally and it worked.Â  The repetition was most likely just superstition. Of course, humans seem bound to this sort of behavior. Rituals exist in every society all around the world.Â  Itâ€™s natural, since each moment offers infinite possibility and demands infinite choice.Â  We come to a crossroads, and we wonder whether to turn left or right, but the possibilities are far vaster than that.Â  We could back up, halt forever, continue straight into the unmarked woodland between the paths, get out of the car and climb a tree, dig a hole, sit on a stump read a book.Â  Ritual saves us from all that.Â  It tells us exactly what to do and how to do it, beautiful for its complete disregard for reason.Â  And itâ€™s completely dependent on our blind adherence.Â  The moment we notice it, the power is shattered.\r\n\r\nYet if, after a period existential crisis, we return to ritual, aware of alternate possibilities, our adherence is more meaningful still, because itâ€™s intentional.Â  Once we are aware of ritual, it becomes a choice.Â  Some of the tracks exemplify ritual, some defy it.Â  Others merely talk about it.Â  But I think in exemplification, defiance, and discussion alike, they share an important traitâ€”awareness. Through pushing ourselves to notice ritual, we arrive at perhaps the most fundamental freedom of artistic expression.Â  Or, at the very least, we give our eleven-year-old fans something to remember.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Track 1 - The Wave Pictures: Just Like A Drummer [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CE02/01 Just Like A Drummer.mp3|titles=Just Like A Drummer|artists=The Wave Pictures]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Track 2 - Debo Band: Adderech Arada [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CE02/02 Aderech Arada.mp3|titles=Adderech Arada|artists=Debo Band]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Track 3 - Spirit Kid: You Lit Up For Me [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CE02/03 You Lit Up For Me.mp3|titles=You Lit Up For Me|artists=Spirit Kid]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Track 4 - Darlingside: Malea [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CE02/04 Malea.mp3|titles=Malea|artists=Darlingside]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Track 5 - Hank &amp; Pigeon: Feathers and Fur [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CE02/05 Feathers and Fur.mp3|titles=Feathers and Fur|artists=Hank and Pigeon]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Track 6 - Pistolera: Policia [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CE02/06 Policia.mp3|titles=Policia|artists=Pistolera]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Track 7 - Chrome &amp; Ice Queen: Sway [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CE02/07 Sway.mp3|titles=Sway|artists=Chrome and Ice Queen]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Track 8 - Jerome Ellis: Hymnal [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CE02/08 Hymnal.mp3|titles=Hymnal|artists=Jerome Ellis]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Track 9 - Villagers: 27 Strangers [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/CE02/09 Twenty Seven Strangers.mp3|titles=Twenty Seven Strangers|artists=Villagers]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/CE02.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

It's quite exciting trying to remember the songs in the middle of concerts.â€\r\n\r\n<strong>Del Bel</strong> plans to perform with a (marginally) stripped-down ensemble of nine.Â <em>â€œ</em><em>I still have other people that recorded on the album that want to join liveâ€ </em><strong>Belluz</strong> jokes,Â <em>â€œbut I think I gotta keep this band smaller than a hockey team.â€ </em>Already, the collective is so large that transportation to shows requires a caravan of automobiles.Â Â Nevertheless, with nearly all nine members involved in three or four additional active projects, I wondered whether logistics might prove problematic.Â <em>â€œ</em><em>I haven't run into too many problems trying to organize this 9 person band,â€</em> Belluz explains,Â <em>â€œbut by all means, I need to book these people way in advance.â€ </em>With regard to creative process, Del Bel seems to have happened upon a functional dynamic rare for bands of such size.Â Â Belluz oversees the artistic direction of the collective, but encourages other members to contribute to the compositional process, with the observation that, â€œ<em>it</em><em> would seem a bit controlling to direct someone on how to cry into their instrument for desired effect.â€</em><em> </em>Thus, Del Bel has coalesced into a more permanent fixture, poised to step from the shadow of the prolific resumes of its membership.\r\n\r\n<strong>Oneiris</strong>, a term that signifies a surreal state,<strong> </strong>is an apt title for the albumâ€”slated to be released on Friday, November 11thÂ in CD, vinyl, and mp3 formatâ€”which evokes a thick dreamlike atmosphere.Â Â Like a dream, its full of unexpected twists and turns.Â Â The eleven tracks on the album all sound very different.Â Â Â <strong>A-Side â€œNo Reservationâ€</strong> andÂ <strong>B-Side â€œInvisible</strong>â€ give a pretty accurate indication of the vast range of styles represented.Â Â Nevertheless, the tracks seem united by a common bond that is difficult to pinpoint.\r\n\r\nA significant part of the bond isÂ <strong>Lisa Conway</strong>, whose dynamic vocals and fresh lyrics mark the Del Bel aesthetic.Â Â <strong>Belluz </strong>describes Conway as a major creative force behind the project, and frames her role in the band as all but crucial.Â Â Therefore, I was surprised to learn that Oneiris was initially recorded as an instrumental album.Â Â Belluz hints that it took a bit of coercion to get long-term co-collaborator Conway on board with the project at first. \"<em>She only quit threeâ€”maybe fourâ€”times,</em>\" he jokes.Â Â <em>â€œTechnically the songs were conceived as weird little instrumentals. But I knew in my heart she would be the (only) one to sing on them.â€</em> Upon further listens, however, we may notice the markÂ <strong>Conway</strong>â€™s indecision has left on the music.Â Â Del Bel seems to draw its unique personality from the uncertain maturation process.Â Â To imagine how it might have sounded otherwise would be to imagine Harry Potter without the scar, or to imagine the Canadian topology unmarred by glaciers that carved itâ€™s lakes and mountains.Â Â <em>â€œI still can't imagine anyone else's reaction to trying to fit vocals lines to the instrumental tracks, </em>confessesÂ <strong>Belluz</strong>. Conwayâ€™s additions are shaped by the unique demands she faced in fitting vocal parts to compositions that had developed without them.Â Â She has taken great care not to intrude upon the musicâ€™s instrumental core.Â Â The tracks unfold at a leisurely rate, andÂ <strong>Oneiris </strong>includes several instrumental interludes. For instance,<strong>â€œInvisibleâ€</strong> forces the listener to wait nearly a third of the track time for vocals to drop.Â Â When they finally do,Â Conwayâ€™s line maintains a tasteful deference to the ensemble, buried behind wispy synths and a persistent piano drone.\r\n\r\nIn general,<strong> Del Bel</strong> devotes a lot more attention to instrumental detail than the typical indie bandâ€”even the typical twelve member indie band, if such an archetype exists.Â Â This comes across not only in the shape of each composition, but also in the intriguing arrangement of acoustic and electric elements. The whispers of keyboards wash over earthy drum grooves and the unpredictable slaps and creaks of a double bass.Â Â Ample credit is also owed toÂ <strong>Heather Kirby</strong>, who mixed the tracks.Â Â All tracks onÂ <strong>Oneiris </strong>suggest a focus on timbre over melody or harmony. â€œ<strong>No Reservation</strong>â€, for instance, builds toward a chorus unusual for its stark lack of harmonic movement, anchored by a memorable riff forcefully delivered in unison by vocals and instruments.Â Â The tune evokes the cabaret-jazz of a bygone era, but it does so with deceptive minimalism, capturing the vibe but rejecting the details.Â Â I recalled a memorable trumpet solo on the track but upon repeat listens, I suddenly realized that there is no trumpet solo whatsoever.Â Â A few growls and single-note burst evoke the sensation as convincingly all the borrowed notes of a Dizzie Gillespie solo.Â Â In that respect, Oneiric seems philosophically a closer relative to a film score than any album by the indie-rock collectives from which it draws members.Â Â And indeed, Del Bel has contributed to numerous film scores, which is a nice accomplishment if you remember that the group has yet to play its first show or release its first album.\r\n\r\nIn short, the ingenuity ofÂ <strong>Del Bel</strong> shines through in the grand scale of the vision, and in the tactful precision with which it has been realized. Listeners will be seduced by the top-notch production and arrangement, while the emotional weight of the composition and nuanced musicianship will keep them hooked.Â Â This music has a lot of layers, and itâ€™s bound to resonate with most audiences.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - No Reservation [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM137 Del Bel/01 No Reservation.mp3|titles=No Reservation|artists=Del Bel]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Invisible [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM137 Del Bel/02 Invisible.mp3|titles=Invisible|artists=Del Bel]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM137 Del Bel.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

For the last five years The Unsacred Hearts have been working towards their latest album, fixing on it like a distant star that's always visible but just barely out of reach. Instrumental versions of the songs have been floating around for years, serving as the soundtrack to band members' lives, both informing and being informed by this great transition. Drummer <strong>Travis Harrison</strong> even walked down the aisle to an early version of <strong>B-Side \"Flesh and Bone\"</strong>. Working off and on at Serious Business Music with a coterie of friends, the album began to take shape, and at last The Unsacred Hearts completed and released <strong>The Honor Bar</strong>. We're thrilled to follow up on our original 7-inch with two tracks from this release, which is available now on CD and Cassette from <a href=\"http://seriousbusinessrecords.com/releases/show/67-The-Honor-Bar\">Serious Business Records</a>.\r\n\r\nI spoke with drummer, producer, and engineer <strong>Travis Harrison </strong>about the new record and the impetus behind <strong>The Unsacred Hearts</strong>' change in musical direction. It was, he explained, an attempt to make music that was more accessible, and that he could put on at home without being asked to turn it down or off. The band simply wanted to make the kind of music that they themselves wished to listen to. After years of punk-inspired invective, The Hearts wanted to recast themselves in a mold that spoke more directly to their current situation. When their self-titled debut was released in 2004 they didn't have families or careers. There's a reason that the music-to-beverage-matching website drinkify.org lists <a href=\"http://drinkify.org/the%20unsacred%20hearts\">\"The Unsacred Hearts\" recipe</a> as 4 oz. Marijuana, 4 oz. Ginger Ale, and 1 oz. Macallan Scotch. They were once young dudes making loud music. Now they're medium-young dudes making listenable music. It's a change that makes most musicians uncomfortable, like they're giving up some essential part of their being by sacrificing the attitudes they developed as teenagers. But what The Unsacred Hearts understand is that their energy and enthusiasm isn't gone, but rather rechanneled into creating a lush musical territory they were once too drunk or nearsighted to fully render. Singer and lyricist <strong>Joe Willie</strong> sums this up wonderfully, <em>\"While we made our bones on ultra-distilled rock and roll, weird chords and wild live sets, we always led with the heart. Loud and fast, yes, but the sonic boom was just the straightest line to the truth.\"</em>\r\n\r\nIf <em>\"the truth\"</em> is something that can be distilled into a song (and I believe it is), then <strong>Joe Willie</strong> is a kind of musical oracle. In his earlier days he came across as a frenzied beat poet frontman, as if someone had given Jim Morrison the stage at an open mic and handed him an eight ball of cocaine. On <strong>The Unsacred Hearts</strong>' latest material he comes off as sage-like, split somewhere between Tom Waits, Lou Reed, and Gil Scott-Heron. The acoustic landscape of this album is less jagged than in past attempts, and Joe Willie's spoken vocals float atop a more serene trajectory, allowing for greater focus on a blended aesthetic and lyrical turns of phrase. In his summary of the album, which is itself a masterful bit of prose, he turns back to New York as a cyclical influence on <strong>The Honor Bar</strong>. He explains, <em>\"The Honor Bar evokes the city of New York itself or, rather, the city resounds in The Honor Bar. The maelstrom and beauty of the city comes across in the sparse, unerring beats, the stark instrumental phrases, the myriad voices in whispers and shouts. Webs of sounds, words and images -- all traffic on the Bowery and midtown sky scrapers -- juxtapose with the sweet intimacy of the fire escape and 2AM walks down solitary side-streets.\"</em> It's a soundtrack not for New York City, but an abstraction of New York City, for those precious few moments when you lose yourself completely in the web of monolithic architecture and compact humanity.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-Side </strong>and title track<strong> \"The Honor Bar\"</strong> fades in to a tumble of percussive thunder and giving way to hand drum percussion and a driving figure on acoustic guitar set to the walking pace of your average long-legged New Yorker. The instrumentation is lush, with glockenspiel, bass, piano, accordion, electric guitar, and a compressed drum set added to the mix at the chorus. There's an electronic vibe to this track that's unheard on previous recordings--the tinkered drum sound and distorted melodic figure on the outro all hint at an extended sonic palette for <strong>The Unsacred Hearts</strong>. It all serves as a backdrop for <strong>Joe Willie's</strong> baritone musings, which are heard with a new depth and resonance thanks to the relative tranquility of the musical accompaniment. This was the last song completed for The Honor Bar, and best encapsulates the attitudes driving the band's project in self-reinvention. This is music I could read to, music I could work to, music I could put on and ignore, but what makes it special is that I wouldn't actually want to do any of those things. Something about it continues to command listeners' full attention, and it does so through a great depth of musical vision rather than pure volume. This more than anything is a sign that The Unsacred Hearts aren't just growing up and continuing to make records--they're maturing.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-Side \"Flesh &amp; Bone\"</strong> is a lyrical pastiche of musical and literary references. Some are undoubtedly intentional and some maybe incidental, but none come off as heavy-handed. Rather, they succeed in evoking the spirit and ambiance of entire songs and imparting some part of their essence and meaning on \"Flesh &amp; Bone\". The complete lyrics are below, with footnotes:\r\n\r\n<em>Picture me, picture you, in a picture book<strong>(1)</strong> we're paging through</em>\r\n<em> Picture me with the slings and the arrows<strong>(2)</strong>, picture me when the dirt road narrows</em>\r\n<em> On a hill, far from home, straits of Gibraltar, streets of Rome<strong>(3)</strong></em>\r\n<em> Mississippi River rolling slow, lost in the rain, Juarez, Mexico<strong>(4)</strong></em>\r\n\r\n<em>When you're tired, when you're on your own</em>\r\n<em> I'll be there, flesh and bone</em>\r\n<em> I miss you, baby, when the river bends<strong>(5)</strong>, I miss you, baby, when the dirt road ends</em>\r\n<em> Picture me, picture you</em>\r\n<em> Picture me, perchance to dream<strong>(6)</strong>, picture you, beside the stream</em>\r\n\r\n<em>When you're weary, when you're on your own</em>\r\n<em> I'll be there, flesh and bone</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>1.) The Kinks - Picture Book:</strong> \"Picture book, pictures of your mama, taken by your papa a long time ago. //Â Picture book, of people with each other, to prove they love each other a long time ago.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>2.) Shakespeare - Hamlet:</strong> \"To be, or not to be, that is the question: // Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer // The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, // Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, // And by opposing end them?\"\r\n\r\n<strong>3.) Bob Dylan - When I Paint My Masterpiece:</strong> \"Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble / Ancient footprints are everywhere / You can almost think that youâ€™re seeinâ€™ double / On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs\"\r\n\r\n<strong>4.) Bob Dylan - Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues:</strong> \"When youâ€™re lost in the rain in Juarez // And itâ€™s Eastertime too // And your gravity fails // And negativity donâ€™t pull you through // Donâ€™t put on any airs // When youâ€™re down on Rue Morgue Avenue // They got some hungry women there // And they really make a mess outta you\"\r\n\r\n<strong>5.) The Country Gentlemen - Down Where:</strong> \"<span style=\"color: #333333;\">Down where the river bends // With God's help we'll meet again // Under the same old sycamore tree</span> //Â <span style=\"color: #333333;\">Proud of each other in the land of the free // </span><span style=\"color: #333333;\">I'll go down to the ocean blue // Just as close as I can to you // This old ocean might keep us apart // But it won't keep you dear from out of my heart</span>\"\r\n\r\n<strong>6.) Shakespeare - Hamlet:</strong> \"To die, to sleep // To sleepâ€”perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub! // For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, // When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, // Must give us pauseâ€”there's the respect // That makes calamity of so long life.\"\r\n\r\nThese references weave an intricate subtext to the song, evoking numerous depictions of death and forcing us to consider the nature of human memories and interactions. The Picture Book reference suggests that we document our own lives only to convince ourselves that we've had substantial experiences once we can no longer feel them so acutely. And yet, though memories fade, some experiences persist across time, and there's an element of humanity's presence that we can seemingly access through locality or state of mind, as indicated by the reference to When I Paint My Masterpiece. But through all this, through hardships and struggle, what should be our relationship with death? Is it an escape or a demise? <strong>Joe Willie</strong> engages this conversation with a text of his own, profoundly contemplating man's position on this earth and our relationship to a hazy past and a precarious future. This interaction is realized musically as an acoustic ballad, giving way to vocal counterpoint between Joe Willie and <strong>guest vocalist Jaymay</strong>, in an exchange that grapples with the eternal nature of true love, which is wholly supported by Willie's lyrics and simultaneously problematized by the various references sprinkled throughout the song. Once fully teased out, it's a brilliant polemic that's typical of Joe Willie's remarkable insight as a lyricist.\r\n\r\nTo round out his description of <strong>The Honor Bar</strong>, Joe Willie writes, <em>\"The Honor Bar is certainly not for everyone and neither are The Unsacred Hearts. When we formed, our only goal was to make rock n roll. We did not ask, what is cool, what do people want to hear, or what should we wear. The only question was, how do we keep playing rock n roll? And, over the years, we kept asking that question with each new song, each live set bringing a response. When we last asked, the answer was The Honor Bar.\"</em> I couldn't have said it better myself.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - The Honor Bar [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM029-1 Unsacred Hearts/01 The Honor Bar.mp3|titles=The Honor Bar|artists=The Unsacred Hearts]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Flesh and Bone [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM029-1 Unsacred Hearts/02 Flesh and Bone.mp3|titles=Flesh and Bone|artists=The Unsacred Hearts]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM029-1 Unsacred Hearts.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

While one must never judge an album on the dessert, here it provides a taste of the contents.Â Â <strong>Rocketship</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Parkâ€™s</strong> original blend of symphonic folk-pop is rich, immediate, and above all, homemade.Â Â NPR noted that it offers â€œ<em>a sense of peace and nostalgia that grounds even the most anxious of listeners</em>.â€\r\n\r\n<strong>Rocketship</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Park</strong><strong> </strong>is the main creative outlet forÂ <strong>Kaufman</strong>, a Brooklyn-based instrumentalist, vocalist, songwriter, producer, andÂ <em>pÃ¢tissier. </em>Kaufman has been an invisible force in the scene for several years.Â Â His talents as a side-man and producer have brought him to the stage and the studio with the likes ofÂ <strong>Dawn Landes</strong>,Â <strong>Caithlin de Marrais</strong>,Â <strong>The National</strong>,Â <strong>Josh Ritter</strong>,Â <strong>Yellowbirds</strong>,Â <strong>Balthrop Alabama</strong>, andÂ <strong>Higgins</strong>.Â Â He has also collaborated with previously featured artistsÂ <strong>Benji Cossa</strong> and theÂ <strong>Unsacred Hearts</strong>.Â Â Kaufman seems at ease in the limelight, though, and the new album reveals that his most impressive talents may be compositional.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-Side â€œSwanâ€</strong> is a small masterpieceâ€”a warm and comfortable track with the potential to provoke a profound emotional response.Â Â One would not often use the termÂ <em>epic</em> to describe a two-minute composition but itâ€™s the only appropriate term here.Â Â The track begins with a simple but powerful chord progression that swells with each successive repetition.Â Â â€œSwanâ€ reaches phenomenal heights, but it never loses the stable foundation on which it is based.Â Â Â With the heart of a folk ballad, it remains sincere and straightforward.Â Â Acoustic guitar and banjo dominate the mix, while innumerable textures flesh out the rough edges with a lush background ambiance.Â Â The brass arrangements, subtle and beautiful, are responsible for much of the effect, with contributions to harmonic depth that makes the simple composition glow.Â Â Â Lyrics prove to be another focal point.Â Â The track revolves around a single phrase:\r\n\r\n<em>I tried to see him,</em>\r\n<em>but he was halfway gone.</em>\r\n<em>Just a battered bird now,</em>\r\n<em>he used to be a strong, strong swan.</em>\r\n\r\nThe sentimental image evokes a sense of loss that darkens the euphoria of the instrumentals.Â Â The words donâ€™t sink in when they are first stated, but they become more and more powerful with each repetition.Â Â On one level, they suggest a cynical reversal of the ugly ducklingâ€™s maturation into an elegant swan.Â Â But I suspect that the message is not just cynicism.Â Â Kaufmanâ€™s choice to ruminate on the lineâ€”rather than to bury it behind more wordsâ€”emphasizes its emotional weight.Â Â When I reflect upon the image, I do not feel duped by an empty metaphor but, rather, privy to an intimate and heartfelt confession.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-Side â€œSee Youâ€</strong> takes the same essential ingredients and draws them out over a much longer span.Â Â <strong>Kaufman </strong>delights us again with a simple chord progression full of harmonic momentum.Â Â The dominant hook is the falsetto vocal line that delineates verses as an interlude.Â Â Â However,Â <strong>Kaufman </strong>remains a compositional minimalist, and lets the track unfold at a leisurely pace.Â Â When the layers of horns, washed out guitars, and noises finally escalate, they seem like a meditation on the words themselves.Â Â Although the song clocks in at nearly five minutes, it seems to bypass time altogether.Â The loops continue to weave on in our sub subconscious even after the music itself has faded out.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cakes &amp; Cookies</strong> marks a slight shift in process sinceÂ <strong>Off &amp; Away</strong>, the artistâ€™s debut album released in 2007.Â Â <strong>Rocketship</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Park</strong> has downsized from a band to a solo initiative.Â Â In some senses, the shift is just semantic.Â Â Kaufman has always been the main impetus behind the project, and even the material on the new album includes important contributions from guestsâ€”most notably,Â <strong>Dawn Landes</strong>,Â <strong>Bryan Devendorf</strong>,Â <strong>Travis Harrison</strong>, andÂ <strong>Nate Martinez</strong>. Â Some of these musicians also appeared on the artistâ€™s debut.Â Â However,Â <strong>Rocketship</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Park</strong> has coalesced primarily around the visions and efforts of Kaufman.Â Â In another recent review, I noted the Toronto-based artist <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem137\">Del Belâ€™s</a> evolution from a one-man studio project to a twelve-member collective posed to take the stage.Â Â <strong>Rocketship</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Park</strong> has headed in the reverse direction.Â Â Kaufman never lost his original vision of a grand, symphonic sound, with rich layers and textures.Â Â Nevertheless, the intimate atmosphere of the studio seems to have meshed well with the individual and reflective nature of the music.Â Â Kaufman uses a lot of overdubs, but itâ€™s notÂ <em>about</em> the overdubs.Â Â Â He employs them as a means rather than an end, to emphasize compositions that remain simple and personal at the core.Â Â Even when I listen to these multilayered recordings, I canâ€™t shake the feeling that Kaufman is seated over in the corner of the room, strumming a battered acoustic and singing his lyrics directly at me.\r\n\r\nA homemade cookie has universal appeal.Â Â However, itâ€™s also a nice gesture that illustrates the very essence ofÂ <strong>Rocketship</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Park</strong>.Â Â In an age where most people get their music on the internet, the artist becomes distanced from the listener.Â Â This is true of double-platinum mainstream artists and obscure independent artists alike.Â Â But the cookie is a solutionâ€”itâ€™s a warm personal touch in a cold digital era.Â Â I feel pretty much the same way aboutÂ RocketshipPark.<strong> </strong> <strong>Kaufman</strong>â€™s music doesnâ€™t merely satisfy your sweet-tooth, but also resonates on a deeper level.Â Â Youâ€™ll find yourself drawn to it for the same reasons you favor your grandmotherâ€™s recipe over the store-bought brand.Â Â The ingredients are preservative free, and theyâ€™re baked with undeniable love.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Swan [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM138 Rocketship Park/01 Swan.mp3|titles=Swan|artists=Rocketship Park]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - See You [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM138 Rocketship Park/02 See You.mp3|titles=See You|artists=Rocketship Park]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM138 Rocketship Park.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

It's a big long desk, and most of the time I have it all to myself. So, I listen to music all day long. Sometimes I go on shuffle adventures, sometimes I let whole albums or compilations play through, but more often than not I get stuck on a song that becomes an anthem of sorts for the day. I get so hooked, so intensely enthused about a single musical event that I seldom make it all the way through on the first attempt. After several repetitions of the first verse and chorus I finally let it play to completion, and then again, and again. When I find a gem like this, it goes in a special playlist. The whole process repeats until the playlist swells to over an hour, at which point I send the whole damn thing out to friends as <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bTaDb\" target=\"_blank\">Force Music On You (FMOU)</a> volume X. It's tough to send folks music without overtones of pretension, so I eschew any greater sense of order and present the whole thing alphabetically by artist, with little to no context or explanation. Of the hundred or so people who subscribe, about 17 download the mix, I would guess maybe 10 actually listen to it, and 2 or 3 send me a note explaining why they loved or hated a particular song. On the week I included <strong>All Fox'sÂ \"Fit To Advise\"</strong>, I received 9 e-mails asking if I could send over the complete album, and 7 follow-up emails asking if I had any more All Fox albums. It's fairly rare for me to include an Ampeater band in an FMOU, let alone one that's still pending consideration for a review. And yet, All Fox defied precedence and spread like wildfire from the Ampeater submissions box to my personal favorites playlist, to the \"most played\" section of my closest friends' iTunes. We do a lot of explaining here on Ampeater, in an attempt to justify exactly why a certain artist merits such a bright spotlight of intellectual scrutiny, but All Fox needs no coaxing to break through the shell of relative obscurity. The music catapults itself across whatever divide supposedly exists between artists and listeners, and once it's playing you have little choice left but to move and be moved by it.\r\n\r\n<strong>All Fox</strong> is primarily <strong>Alex Fox Tschan</strong>, a 25 year old from Deltaville, VA who cites his father as his greatest hero, and was very nearly Dr. Alex Tschan, but for a bold decision to redirect his sights towards Brooklyn and a subsequent renaissance in his creative faculties. He left Virginia Tech in 2008 with a degree in Biochemistry, but with a penchant for deep thought and a sense that there remained something unfulfilled in his musical potential. Tschan has been taking tentative stabs at music making for the last ten years, but only saw his talent develop during college, as he found confidence in his once timid voice and realized that he would only (and could only) full explore the range possibilities available to him if he focused solely on his craft. Medical school isn't exactly known for the range of diversions available during one's free time, so he put his foot down and kicked a hitch in the hitherto straight-arrow path his life had taken to date. Working crap jobs for crap pay, Tschan made use of the time afforded to him by a flexible schedule to make music. In an <a href=\"http://sweetteapumpkinpie.com/2011/05/14/interview-alex-fox-tschan-on-the-all-fox-lp-peaceful-heart/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Sweet Tea Pumpkin Pie</a>, he reflected, <em>\"For me, despite being broke, it has given me more energy and happiness to put towards my friendships, ideas, poems, songs, etc. than I could have ever dreamed. It has been the most rewarding and prolific time of my life, and it feels like itâ€™s just starting.\"</em>\r\n\r\nLeaving <strong>Alex Tschan</strong> at home in Virginia, it was <strong>All Fox</strong> that made the migration to Brooklyn, and he made it with an astonishing purity of intent. Long since a mecca for rising stars, New York has a tendency to attract the kind of assholes who buy guitars to \"hit it big\", \"make bank\", and \"get laid\". All Fox came to our fair town with the hope of growing his art, escaping parental and societal expectations, and discovering what it is that makes music a successful medium for the transmission of ideas and emotions. Whether it's work on his latest LP, screenplay, poem, or community project, All Fox has the insight of a genuine artist, and the dedication to produce work at a prolific rate. When I last wrote him about his Ampeater submission, he had not one, not two, but several albums worth of material for my perusal that had been completed in the months since his original submission. The songs on this 7-inch are culled from his first full-length solo album <strong>Peaceful Heart</strong>. Performed with a coterie of musicians on a huge variety of instruments, the album lands somewhere between Sufjan Stevens circa 2005 and Animal Collective arranged for chamber orchestra. Influences range from Sam Cooke to Walt Whitman, and seep out into the music as it skirts the edges of one's expectations. All Fox's songs assume a kind of crystalline structure, darting here and there with the confidence that its message can be conveyed in a more sophisticated manner than most pop songs presume. He goes so far as to assume an intelligent listener, or at the very least one that leaves a channel open for suggestion. Songs can take a number of approaches to satisfying listeners. Sometimes they're linear, moving from Point A to Point B in a swell that peaks and then recedes; sometimes they're circular, progressing in closed sequential loops of verse, pre chorus, and chorus; but sometimes they're a wonderful pastiche of influences, attitudes, and impulses that suggest more than define the final destination of a particular songspace. It's this latter mode that represents the predominant approach used by All Fox, and it's indicative of a genuinely great mind at work, crafting something potent on a higher order than the blues and folk based idioms that are mixed so thoroughly with American soil you can practically taste them in a McDonalds hamburger. All Fox makes music that's ever so slightly foreign to the average Joe, but that nevertheless resonates deeply with something fundamental in the human spirit.\r\n\r\nIn his Ampeater submission, <strong>All Fox</strong> included a <a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/?m422gccmb6za16s\" target=\"_blank\">link to download the full album</a>, complete with lyric sheets for each song. Tschan's words are poetic, and it's but a small stretch to assume that many of them might have begun as actual poems. I had the chance to speak with Alex on the phone, and he came across as part scholar, part artist, and part philosopher, dispensing wisdom on music (both his own and other people's) with a kind of insight and reflection that's rare in young musicians. He explained, <em>\"a poem, and a song, and a story, a piece of art, a movie, they're all the same thing--they could all be called 'Fit to Advise'\"</em>. It's the notion of transferral across media, that a song possesses an essence that can be conveyed in another form. It's a more extreme version of the reduction that happens between record and stage; a great symphonic epic performed on solo acoustic guitar is still that same song, its essence is just captured using a different set of tools. I get the sense that All Fox would make music with the world if he could wrap his hands around mountains and smash them together. He explained, <em>\"Melodies happen in my head, and it's my job to make sure I get them down. Sometimes I hear whole songs, fully orchestrated, but I don't always have the tools to make them a reality.\"</em> The success of <strong>A-side \"Fit To Advise\"</strong> is in joining together odd rhythmic fragments into a song structure that's wholly unorthodox and yet captures listeners in an organic flow from section to section. It's almost classical in its motif-oriented composition, introducing sound objects or textures that grow, evolve, and re-appear at various points throughout the song. Every word, every sound is intentional. When you listen, focus not only on the music or lyrics, but on the intersection of the two. Pay attention to how the soundscape colors the text, and whether it remains constant or fluctuates across multiple repetitions. There's meaning stuffed into every crevice of this song, and I question whether I'm \"Fit to Advise\" (har har) on the author's primary intent, or whether there even exists such a thing in the complicated brain of Alex Tschan, but I nevertheless present the lyrics here for your consideration as you listen:\r\n\r\n<em>Hey little brother! Let's go for a ride!\r\n</em><em>But clean that look off your eyes first.\r\n</em><em>Man, I told you before! â€¦ if i'm fit to drive, then I am sure as hell fit to advise you.\r\n</em><em> </em>\r\n\r\n<em>Hey little brother, whatcha got on your mind???\r\n</em><em>I guarantee you I've been below that line.\r\n</em><em>So I wouldn't worry!\r\n</em><em>Between drugs &amp; womenâ€¦ you'll be doin' alright if at least one ain't hard to find.</em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n<em>I know you burn with desire, but easy tiger, she's so lovely &amp; complex.\r\n</em><em>Please, take my advice before you startâ€¦\r\n</em><em> </em>\r\n\r\n<em>I know you're dying to try it, but easy tigerâ€¦ have you researched its full effects?\r\n</em><em>Please, take my advice before you startâ€¦</em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n<em>And if you're ever feeling expired! Well, easy tiger, it goes one right through the head!\r\n</em><em>Please, take my advice before you start...</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>B-Side \"Engelhard Grocery 1997: Mama's Outta Stamps\"</strong> is a beautiful ascent to an extended instrumental outro. After a single verse we're lifted up by layered guitars, strings,Â  and scattered percussion. It's a cathartic release after the relative chaos of <strong>\"Fit to Advise\"</strong>. I was recently asked by a music loving friend if electronic instruments were now the predominant method of creating music. The answer is certainly \"no\", but that's almost beside the point. That some people even consider this a binary question is my main concern, and a continued source of bewilderment to me. Most of <strong>All Fox's</strong> songs exist in a realm that pull heavily from both sides of this spectrum--acoustic banjos mingle with heavily processed electric guitars, digital production, orchestral strings (sometimes electrified), and even oboe. Most people develop proficiency with a tool and then only later discover the creative possibilities made possible by the skills they've acquired. All Fox turns this paradigm on its head and brings artifacts into being almost as an act of immaculate creation, inspired by nothing more than some whisper in the back of his thoughts that he's then able to harness and make real. The result is not only praiseworthy but almost enviable. He's currently working as part of a collective, inspired by the psychology of Jung and the poetry of Rumi. I've been sworn to secrecy on the details of the operation, but there are exciting things coming our way from All Fox, so stay tuned while he learns to move mountains.

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\"><img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Slow Motion Centerfold\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SMC-in-NYC-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><strong>Slow Motion Centerfold</strong> may seem rather anomalous when viewed alongside the artists weâ€™ve featured in the past on the Ampeater Review.  We tend to shy away from music with blatant popular appeal, and the music featured in this particular review has a lot of that.  Both tracks could be massive radio hits.   Nevertheless, I feel that the appeal of Slow Motion Centerfoldâ€™s music extends far beyond the popular and borders on the universal.  The Nashville-based quintet draws together the best qualities of mainstream pop-rock, implements them with unparalleled expertise, and forgoes the undesirable bullshit often associated with the genre.  Biases aside, it was a band that needed to be written up.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-Side â€œAlma Roseâ€</strong> was the track that convinced me.  I first heard it several months ago and itâ€™s floated in my head ever since.  â€œAlma Roseâ€ is packed with hooks so memorable that each one could merit a hit and, in sum, they amount to an epic hit.  It begins with an ephemeral and melodic guitar riff that soars when the full band kicks in behind it.  From here the band sinks into a more subdued verse, fueled by a drum and bass groove reminiscent of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, circa 1999.  That comparison is no doubt bolstered by the voice of <strong>Alex Hall</strong>, whose extensive dynamic phrasing and subtle drawl hint at the power hidden behind the smooth poise.  When the chorus finally hits, it delivers all we could hope for, melodic and powerful.\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œAlma Roseâ€ </strong>derives its unique (oxymoronic?) polished power in part from expert production.  <strong>Slow Motion Centerfoldâ€™s</strong> debut album, <strong><em>Rock the Body Language</em></strong>, bears the mark of producer Brian Virtue, whose rÃ©sumÃ© includes work with main-stream rock icons like Jane's Addiction, 30 Seconds to Mars, Audioslave, Deftones, etc.\r\nThe album is a bit of a throwback to these commercially successful rockersâ€”the crunch of power chords and crash of symbols come across as heavy yet accessible.\r\n\r\nCommercial may seem like the antithesis of indie, but it doesnâ€™t have to be.  To be commercial, an artist must be popular.  An artist cannot be popular unless it appeals to the listener.  When you tweak that notion, the rejection of popular music signifies the rejection of the listener.  We must then be suspicious of the artist that claims to not give a shit about the public, then, for such claims are inherently paradoxical.  An artist with a true distain for the public wouldnâ€™t bother to release an album or perform a show.  To do so engages the listener and invites feedback, whether positive or negative.  So, in a sense, doesnâ€™t all music seek to be popular?\r\n\r\n<strong>â€œAlma Roseâ€</strong> contains much more than the fluff weâ€™d expect from a track with such immediate appeal.  The title lyric is a reference to a violinist who was deported to a concentration camp, where he was forced to lead an orchestra of prisoners as they played for their lives.  <strong>B-Side â€œSuper Grand Masterâ€</strong> reveals a similar hidden weight.  On first glance, it seems like a textbook pop-rock anthem with so many memorable sections that itâ€™s hard to determine which one is the real chorus.  (Is it the vocal harmonies at 43-seconds?  The hits at 49-seconds?  The unexpected heartbreak chord and reggae backbeat at 53 seconds?) Hidden behind these immediate pleasures, however, the lyrics reveal a mix of highbrow geekdom and punk attitude.  The title is a reference to chess, and the verses were conceived as a â€œstring of couplets.â€ Meanwhile, guitarist <strong>Chris Smith</strong> describes the principle theme as a <em>â€œrally cry against narrow minded anti-visionaries who sleep in silk pajamas and are scared of people with Mohawks.â€</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Slow Motion Centerfold</strong> manages to weave these seemingly disparate elements together with ease.   That stems in part from the fact that the band is comprised of childhood friends and includes a pair of brothers.<strong> Smith</strong> notes that <em>â€œlongterm friendship and brotherhood make the songwriting process more challenging but more rewarding.  There is a great deal of trust and awareness of what we are all capable of contributing to a song, so if someoneâ€™s slacking, they arenâ€™t going to get away with it.â€</em> It may be a mixed blessing, but I feel as if the bond between members is a significant element in the equationâ€”it endows the music with added personality and comfort.  Process may also factor into it.  Slow Motion Centerfoldâ€™s compositions all stem from instrumental hooks but were developed piece by piece, as the band members were once scattered across different states.  <strong>Hall</strong> observes that, <em>â€œWe used to write songs by sending pieces of demos through email.  Then we'd put everything together during live rehearsals.  We still work in this way even though we live in the same zip code.â€</em> In the process, we see an inherent balance between the immediate that the reflectiveâ€”creation and revision.\r\n\r\nWe can all rattle off a short list of artists that have managed to appeal to the public and the critics alike.  However, we tend to view these artists as an exception to the rule, and marvel at how theyâ€™ve struck a balance.  <strong>Slow Motion Centerfold</strong> has carved a much more holistic path.  Where other artists have seen inherent conflict and struggled for compromise, Slow Motion Centerfold has found the potential for symbiosis.  Popular and immediate appeal serves as a gateway to the heavier stuff.  It does not detract from the more enduring qualities of the music but, rather, allows the impatient easy access to those qualities.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve been meaning to write up <strong>Slow Motion Centerfold</strong> for several months.  Instead I procrastinated.  With each month, I was afraid that Iâ€™d miss my window, and that the band would make it big before I got to it.  Lucky for me, that hasnâ€™t happened yet, but Iâ€™m certain itâ€™s just a matter of time.  Now and then a hit comes along that deserves the heavy rotation it gets.  The two tracks featured in this review could be those hits.  I wouldnâ€™t mind hearing them in car commercials or piped into the aisles at CVS.  For now, though, letâ€™s enjoy them from the comfort of our home stereos.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Alma Rose [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM140 Slow Motion Centerfold/01 Alma Rose.mp3|titles=Alma Rose|artists=Slow Motion Centerfold]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Super Grand Master [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM140 Slow Motion Centerfold/02 Super Grand Master.mp3|titles=Super Grand Master|artists=Slow Motion Centerfold]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM140 Slow Motion Centerfold.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Officially, that is. Behind closed doors, there's a handful of artists we take home with us--they live on our iPods and in our car stereos. They know our personal Gmail addresses and together we've listened, hand in hand, to gentle folk ballads about Goatse. These are the privileged few, and we'd bend over backwards to see their records top the charts. If you've been paying any attention to Ampeater over the last few years, you might have noticed that Uncles is one of the elect. They first appeared with a digital 7-inch on <a href=\"/aem092\">AEM092</a>, then returned will a full stream of their last album \"Replacing Words With Other Words\". We brought them into the studio for a <a href=\"/casualbusiness03\">Casual Business session</a> and included them on our first <a href=\"ce01\">Concrete Experience mixtape</a>.

In the Pulitzer-worthy shot, we get the obligatory group of mostly-bearded dudes who, letâ€™s face it, are obviously musicians, seated around a table about to collapse under the weight of several handles of booze, cans of red bull, and cups filled to various degrees with unknown liquids that could have been left out for days and, odds are, were used as ashtrays at some point or another, although they donâ€™t appear to have done much good because most of the ash ended up on the table anyway.  Upon closer examination, we wonder why the top half of a water bottle is just sitting out there and for what sketchy purpose it was sawed off at the middleâ€”perhaps an improvised smoking device, although thereâ€™s certainly enough rolling papers around that it wouldnâ€™t have been necessary, even if it would have been possible thanks to the requisite roll of duct tape.  In the background, we notice bookshelves crammed with impressive tomes that appear to have received a lot of love, of which by far the most visible title reads, New York City.  How perfect.\r\n\r\nYes, <strong>Clear Plastic Masks</strong> is a bit dirtier than the rest, and itâ€™s not just the name, which frontman <strong>Andrew Katz</strong> explains was inspired by a male friend he watched perform under the female alter-ego Anita Fix and who, dressed in a slutty miniskirt and a flimsy blouse unbuttoned to the navel, wore a clear plastic mask layered thick with lipstick and mascara.   <em>â€œIt was fucking mesmerizing,â€</em> Katz recalls, and I donâ€™t doubt him at all.  To top it off, apparently, the name was also chosen to evoke the â€œthe greatâ€ Bill Lambeer, who twice led the Detroit Pistons to the NBA Championships, but is best remembered as one of the most notorious foulers to ever set foot on the court.  Thatâ€™s certainly not the most palatable set of influences, and begs the question of just what kind of image the band hopes to conjure.  I should probably add that the name Clear Plastic Masks was only decided upon after careful deliberation.  <em>â€œWe were trying to find something hip and catchy that the kids would like like The Dongs or The Biscuit Fuckers but got sick of the search and decided to go full weirdo instead,â€</em> Katz elaborates, and I canâ€™t quite tell whether heâ€™s sincere, sarcastic, or somewhere in between.\r\n\r\nWith the music itself, the focal point becomes not so much the inherent grit but the deceptively clean faÃ§ade.  There are plenty of bands that sound a lot filthier than <strong>Clear Plastic Masks</strong>.  Weâ€™ve probably even reviewed a few of them on Ampeater.  What makes this artist special is how the grime is hidden behind the proverbial clear plastic mask.  And, the important thing to remember about this plastic mask is that itâ€™s clear, so you can still see whatâ€™s on the other side.\r\n\r\nTake <strong>A-Side â€œWorking Girl,â€</strong> for instance, which conjures a false sense of comfort rooted in familiar archetypesâ€”a timeless chord progression, a sensual soul groove, smooth electronic organ, etc.  However, the astute listener will sense from the start that the mix is a bit off.  The murky outline of some deviant madness taints the music and, as the composition unfolds, peels away at the re-appropriated faÃ§ade.  Lo-fi production is one obvious culprit.  The huge dynamic range and natural delivery of <strong>Katzâ€™s</strong> vocals is accentuated every time he overdrives the mic.  The grungy distortion also makes the whole mix seem much louder, favorably evoking a bootleg 8-track aesthetic.  That said, <strong>Clear Plastic Masks</strong> is definitely a band that excels in the live setting and, letâ€™s face it, the kind of venue where this music would feel most at home is a place where the sound is inevitably terrible but the volume is so high you donâ€™t noticeâ€”the kind of place that smells like Bill Lambeerâ€™s old locker and where you leave with a lingering ringing in your ears.\r\n\r\nThese endearingly off-putting qualities have earned <strong>Clear Plastic Masks</strong> a number of comparisons to the Black Keys.  However, to me, it seems a lot less premeditated.  Plenty of bands embrace the do-it-yourself craze as a way to grow themselves a fake set of ballsâ€”to feign the grit of authenticityâ€”but Clear Plastic Masks employs it so convincingly that it seems essential rather than superficial.  You wonâ€™t be fooled by (nor does the band hope to fool you with) the sleek Motown vibe which obscures the true grime like a blast of Ferbreze might obscure the stench of sex and cigarettes in a cheap motel room.  If Marvin Gaye is the kinda music that makes you wanna turn the lights down low and get it on, this music is about getting laid and, if you happen to turn the lights down low, itâ€™s just so you donâ€™t notice the bedbugs and bloodstains on the mattress.\r\n\r\nIf production alone is not enough to ripple the conventional gloss, we get the lyrics, which are refreshingly honest and rife with sexual innuendo.  I canâ€™t help but respect <strong>Katzâ€™s</strong> plea to the working girl: <em>â€œif all my morning daydreams came true, I just might spend my day working on you!â€</em> Yet some of lyrics are less metaphorical than one might expect.  For instance, the line about being distracted by the beautiful girl on the freeway and driving out of the lanes is straightforward narration.  <em>â€œWe all used to work as movers together, Matt and Charlie still do, riding around in a box truck all day carrying peoples shit and watching the world go by and I guess this song just came out of all of that, all the incredible girls you see cruising around this town.â€</em> Sure, you can joke that these guys have earned the right to wear the trucker hats that so many hip indie rockers wear ironically, but I think weâ€™d be missing the more important point.  These straightforward and uncontrived references endow the music with an authentic or deep seeded sense of the blues, a term I use not as a genre but as a state of mind.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-Side â€œPegasus in Glueâ€</strong> is a lot louder and heavier than<strong> â€œWorking Girlâ€</strong>, but seems to stem from the same general philosophy.  Here, the clear plastic mask that the artist dons appears to come from the classic punk rock tradition, an influence we hear most clearly in the half-sung/half-chanted chorus, and in the enormous drum fills.  Yet, after the second verse, the composition spirals into a loud but vaguely psychedelic melee of sounds.  Even though it only lasts for minute, it creates the impression of being stuck in a never-ending trip, and debunks all attempts to pigeonhole the artist within a particular norm.  The digression evokes the unsettling soundtrack to a broken merry-go-round, sometimes dragging at half-speed, other times spinning faster and faster.\r\n\r\n<strong>Clear Plastic Masks</strong> is pretty unabashed about its influences.  The artist makes no pretentious claims to be original or unprecedented.  <strong>Katz</strong> explains that the impetus for <strong>â€œWorking Girlâ€</strong> came from a lick stolen from an Otis Redding tuneâ€”which he promptly adds was also used by the Beatles and a million other song writersâ€”and which he crafted into his own composition with the guidance of guitarist and keyboardist <strong>Matt Menold</strong>.  With <strong>â€œPegasus in Glueâ€</strong>, the influences are even more specific and, to an extent, absurd.  Katz recounts how the heavy bass and drums remind him of a <em>â€œfunk version of the theme from Space Odessy 2001 in the movie Being There in the scene when Chauncey Gardner first leaves the confines of his father's house and hits the rough streets of D.C. for the first time.â€</em> Call it a delusion of grandeur, call it genius, but these confessions also tap into an important recognition that most music amounts to little more than a combination of all the weird shit weâ€™ve soaked in over our lives and all the weird shit floating around in our minds.\r\n\r\nOn that note, I feel that <strong>Clear Plastic Masks</strong> ought to be viewed as a found artist.  The band takes disperse elements that have been cast out on the sidewalk and rearranges them in a way that their former owners would probably not approve of butâ€”lo and beholdâ€”work a lot better than the rejected originals.  And, as a pleasant byproduct, the result has the feel of an instant classic.  When I hear Clear Plastic Masks, I hear an old hit played back on a transistor radio in a post apocalyptic future on the heap of junk and ruins that used to be Manhattan.  Maybe youâ€™ll hear something different, but I encourage you to let your imagination run wild.  Just remember to wash your hands afterwards.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Working Girl [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM141 Clear Plastic Masks/01 Working Girl.mp3|titles=Working Girl|artists=Clear Plastic Masks]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Pegasus in Glue [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM141 Clear Plastic Masks/02 Pegasus.mp3|titles=Pegasus|artists=Clear Plastic Masks]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM141 Clear Plastic Masks.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Festival</strong> inÂ Guelph,Â Ontario.Â  Each remix was produced by a different DJ from GuelphÂ in a different style in honor of the festival.\r\n\r\nFor those who canâ€™t bear to wait a few more hours, check out the streamable/downloadable remix ofÂ <strong>â€œNo Reservation.â€ </strong>You may remember the composition fromÂ <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/aem137\" target=\"_blank\">AEM137</a>.Â  To appreciate the remix, we recommend that you listen to both versions side-by-side.Â  While the original is rooted around a heavy bass groove, the remix unfolds at a slower pace, leaving the listener in anticipation of that magic moment when the beat drops and the crowd goes wild.\r\n\r\nThe remix was produced byÂ <strong>Live Action Fezz</strong>, a multimedia artist and designer best known as a member of the popular indie dance-rock bandÂ <strong>Green Go</strong>.\r\n\r\nThose who want to hear more can purchase the full remix album through Del Belâ€™sÂ <a href=\"http://delbel.bandcamp.com/album/kareemix-abdel-jabbel\" target=\"_blank\">Bandcamp page</a>.Â  In addition to the digital version, the collective is offering a â€˜semi-physicalâ€™ version of the release with small versions of the poster attached <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM137-1 Del Bel/Del Bel.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (with the download code behind it), accompanied by a Kareem Abdul Jabbar basketball card.\r\n\r\nWhy Kareem Abdul Jabbar?Â  Well, why not!Â  He seems like a safer choice of basketball hero than Bill Lambeer, the legendary fouler commemorated in my recent review of Clear Plastic Masks.\r\n\r\nAlso, when you take a close look at the event poster, youâ€™ll notice that his name makes a nice allusion to remixes, Del Bel, and the Kazoo!

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Plume Giant Sprague Sessions\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/PlumeGiantSpragueSessions-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />In late March of this year, <strong>Nolan Green</strong> invited me to hear his band <strong>Plume Giant</strong> perform a short set of songs at Sprague Hall in New Haven, CT. A spacious, architecturally beautiful, and acoustically rich recital space, Sprague typically hosts concerts by Yale School of Music students and faculty, as well as all manner of visiting classical and jazz artists. Bass great Ron Carter played there a few days before our session. The week after, the St. Louis String Quartet performed a selection of quartets by Mozart and John Adams. It is, in other words, not the exactly the kind of place youâ€™d expect to go see your friendâ€™s band cut a handful of tracks. And yet, listening to the results, Spragueâ€™s lofty pedigree proves an unexpectedly keen match to Plume Giantâ€™s elegant, haunting, and immaculately executed songs. The recording is crystal clear, and Iâ€™d say less than half of that has to do with the Hallâ€™s legendary sonics. From the intricately woven harmonies of â€œKensico Dam,â€ to the coy insistence of Dan Hickâ€™s staple â€œOld Timey Baby,â€ the trio of singer/guitarist Green, guitarist/fiddler/singer Oliver Hall, and fiddler/vocalist Eliza Bagg make music whose referents range from the raucous idioms of American folk, to the restraint and subtlety of a chamber ensemble, to the grit and humor of a touring bar band. Surprises are abundant in these recordings, but the ever-shifting structures, the complex interplay of the three voices, the endlessly inventive variations of recurring themes never seem manipulative or academic. Rather, Plume Giant performs with an honesty that makes no apologies about its talent, its willingness to go to harmonic and compositional places few other bands would even attempt, let alone pull off. In the interview below, Bagg discusses how the trio tries to create â€œa specific worldâ€ for each song they write and perform. Like any world worth visiting, Plume Giantâ€™s tracks ask the listener to do a little exploring. For every standout hook, every beautiful stretch of a song, there exist hidden moments of weirdness, nooks and crannies that only come to the surface over repeated trips. When you leave, these places stick with you, like a bramble you find latched onto your sock after a long hike. Plume Giant took me on a journey that night at Sprague Hall. This session is what we brought back.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. How did the band get together? Was there an evolutionary period before you became Plume Giant?</strong>\r\n\r\nNolan and Oliver were both involved with popular music things at Yale [University]. Nolan ran an organization called Yale Music Scene, and it hosted open mics at which both Oliver and Nolan played. Oliver even ended up hosting some of these in his dorm room. Nolan and Oliver liked each other's stuff, so they started \"making music\" together. At first these \"jam sessions\" were fairly directionless, or perhaps too direction-full. We still joke about the early days when Oliver would play the electric bass with Nolan on mandolin, but there are a few songs from those days that are still around. Oliver and I met playing in a classical string quartet, and a few months after the boys formed Plume Giant, Oliver asked me to come sing on a few songs. After a few awkward performances during which I joined the boys for three or four songs on the set, we all decided that I should just join the band. There were a few key rehearsals that I remember, the three of us sitting together to come up with harmonies for â€œOld Joeâ€ and â€œWait it Outâ€, that really began to define our sound.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. What do you think the most important aspects of Plume Giant are in terms of your sound, songwriting, and personnel.</strong>\r\n\r\nFor me, Plume Giant's emphasis on collaboration is paramount. Collaboration is vital to our songwriting, as well as to our larger artistic vision. Suffice it to say we have a lot of discussion in Plume Giant. We discuss just about everything we do, and are constantly bringing in to the conversation ideas from other artists we've heard or seen, whether they're musicians or other artists. We're all about keeping the flow of ideas going, in terms of songwriting, instrumentation, harmony construction, and even just our general aesthetic. Secondly, collaboration is fundamental to the kind of music we make. Listening to each other while we're performing is arguably the most important element of our performances, both for the sake of musicianship and intonation, and also for picking up on vibes and energy. I think we're really tuned into each other at this point, and itâ€™s so important that we work as a team in both the creative and performative components of our work.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Can you tell me a little about the new album you're working on, and how it relates to your previous recordings?</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile our new album continues to feature our voices--the focus is still definitely on the three of us singing together--we've made a huge effort to diversify our sound, or, as we like to think of it, to fully explore the widest realms and most varied elements of our sound. We've really tried to capture, or at least understand, the strange and different creature that is each song on the album, and this means trying to create a specific world for each song. Part of this comes from having performed so much. We already have strong associations and feelings attached to the live performances of many of the songs on the album, and we want to best recreate those feelings, or the kind of energy that accompanies the songs, in the recording of them. While this was certainly a goal of the EP, we've allowed ourselves to take more risks with this new album, and the songs have had longer to marinate. We've really given ourselves the time and space to explore the places that each song can go.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Who are some other musicians or bands that are touchstones for you guys?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe really listen to many different kinds of music, and, while a lot of it sounds almost nothing like us, I would say that we try to absorb ideas from all of it. Some groups that we listen to often, or take a lot from, are Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks, The Dirty Projectors, Radiohead, Bill Callahan, Paper Bird, Arcade Fire, Joni Mitchell, Grizzly Bear, The Beach Boys, Wilco, Tom Waits, and, of course, The Beatles.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. What do you envision for the tour this summer?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe're really excited for the summer tour. Aside from our time in Colorado, which was set up by our friend Macon in Paper Bird, the whole tour's been self-booked. It's been a ton of work but is allowing us to play with different local bands at each stop that we really dig. The back-and-forth with local bands--setting up the bill, confirming the venue, working on promo--gives us a feel for the music scene in each city and makes each stop its own little special event rather than just another hit and run bar show. First we have to graduate, but come May we're hopeful that the tour will get folks all over the country excited about the record release later this summer.\r\n\r\n<em>We'll be posting a video a day over the next 4 days, culminating with the release of the entire session on MP3, available as a FREE DOWNLOAD.

		"content" : "<div class=\"review\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright pressphoto\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"Pinebocks\" src=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Pinebocks-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThere's a recent New Yorker article in which Arthur Krystal defends pulp novels against a perceived onslaught from the community of intellectuals who would happily see the vast majority of printed word scarified at the altar of literary fiction. Brought on by an incident in which President Obama admitted a less than challenging summer reading list, there's developed a vibrant polemic surrounding popular versus literary fiction. In the interest of mediating this dispute, Krystal ultimately convinces his readers that there exists a class of literary-minded pulp authors who deliver the insight of highbrow fiction in somewhat less auspicious packages. These gifted writers sculpt sentences with the same care as their Oxford colleagues, but do us the kindness of placing verbs and nouns in an order to which we're more accustomed. It's this class of artist that we like to represent on Ampeater--populists who practice their craft with diligence and care, but make music rooted in traditions that evoke a visceral reaction in listeners. So, when Cory Clifford of <strong>Pinebocks</strong> sent a 7-inch our way, we knew he was someone you needed to hear.\r\n\r\nDrenched in reverb and propelled by the buzz of a distantly mic'd acoustic guitar, the songs on this 7-inch soar with vocal melodies, well placed harmonies, and lyrics pronouncing the joys and vagaries of love. While speaking with Cory in preparation for this review, the realization came to me that he's one of us, a music-obsessive with a near exhaustive mental codex of bands, songs, dates, chords, and unreleased albums, ranging from 70s soul and power pop to new wave and 90s indie rock. The confluence of songwriting styles and harmonic decisions on this 7-inch is no mistake, but rather a carefully pasted collage of influences, paying subtle homage to the heroes that inspired the music of <strong>Pinebocks</strong>. Cory had little interest in music while growing up in Pittsburgh. It was a move to Chicago that introduced him to the city's DIY culture and set him started on the path to a career in music. He had previously sung for a friend's band, but they kicked him out after a brief stint, and he used the opportunity to pick up guitar, delving into the Kinks catalog to such a great extent that he now refers to his songwriting style as an Americanized interpretation of Ray Davies.\r\n\r\nOn first listen to <strong>A-Side Love Is Grand(ish)</strong>, it occurred to me that despite the song's lo-fi production, it sounded remarkably finished. Not polished, but somehow complete. It's been said the Minutemen didn't write songs but rather produced blueprints for songs, sketches that someone else could gussy up for the masses. <strong>Pinebocks</strong> songs at once stand alone as untouchable artifacts while simultaneously demanding an entire array of rich orchestration. With nothing other than a guitar and voice (plus the occasional trumpet courtesy of friend Mark Jaeschke), Cory's able to suggest a lush soundscape that accompanies each song in the imagination of listeners. There are certain points in a piece of music, particularly harmonically, at which an artist is presented with a choice between two or more options that will either make the song more or less interesting. At every juncture, Cory chooses the correct path, pushing his melodies to a level of perfection through self-awareness and criticism that's seldom seen in even the most talented artists. As a student of independent rock and pop music, he's spent time considering what makes a great song, and as a result he's emerged with keen instincts. Cory can sense when a song's been overcomplicated, and when it's been oversimplified, when it's time to stop and when to keep pushing. This is how and why his songs are able to strike a balance of fullness, even as he struggles against the limitations of his one man acoustic setup. In a situation with acoustic guitar and vocals, it frequently happens that one or the other element takes precedence. Whether it's the punch of a beat-up Martin or the confidence of a poet reciting his own verse, one part takes lead while the other follows. In the world of Ampeater it's more often guitar than vocals that plays the alpha male, but for Pinebocks it's quite the opposite. In both <strong>Love Is Grand(ish)</strong> and its short but infectious <strong>B-Side Love Is A Consolation Prize</strong>, guitar exists as a metronome, filling up an otherwise empty part of the spectrum while Cory's voice pulls us along through each song, in a manner that brings to mind the great and almost mythical crooner Scott Walker, and the also great but somewhat less mythical <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/AEM036\">Benji Cossa</a>. Pinebocks makes the shortlist for my upcoming album of \"Musicians and Celebrities Reading and Singing the Phonebook\". I think I'll put him as track 4, between Morgan Freeman and David Attenborough.Â  <strong></strong>\r\n\r\nCory took some scattered lessons as a teenager, but only really began to develop his own sense of musical style when he started spending time with other aspiring musicians. He emerged with a sensibility honed as much by his peers as it was by The Clean, The Cure, Robert Pollard, and The Go-Betweens. Even the name <strong>Pinebocks</strong> was assembled from the Beat Happening song Pine Box Derby, mixed with the name of a local amber \"bock\" beer, thus Pinebocks. It's a happy coincidence that the band name was itself born from the same combination of indie scholarship and day-to-day observations as the music it would come to produce.\r\n\r\nRounding off with <strong>B-Side \"Love Is A Consolation Prize\"</strong>, this single will be the last acoustic release from Pinebocks. Unlike the inheritors of the folk coffeehouse tradition, <strong>Pinebocks</strong> yearns for greener pastures, and Cory's already on the lookout for bandmates to give his latest compositions life as electric creations. He's now living and working in Texas, and will be taking the full-blown band out on tour as soon as possible. While we're thrilled to have represented these Pinebocks tunes on Ampeater, Cory confessed that the best is yet to come. There are songs he's written that he couldn't do justice with an acoustic guitar, and so rather than dilute his vision he's simply holding them in cold storage until he can more fully realize the sounds circling around his head. With a band nearly in place, it's looking like we'll get to hear those sounds sooner rather than later. In the meantime, we're delighted to introduce <strong>Pinebocks</strong> and <strong>Cory Clifford</strong> to the world--heads up guys, this is one to keep tabs on.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pinebocks.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.pinebocks.bandcamp.com</a>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ben Heller</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Love Is Grandish [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM142 Pinebocks/01 Love Is Grandish.mp3|titles=Love Is Grandish|artists=Pinebocks]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Love Is A Consolation Prize [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM142 Pinebocks/02 Love Is A Consolation Prize.mp3|titles=Love Is A Consolation Prize|artists=Pinebocks]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM142 Pinebocks.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

And when Aiken offered to help him find a new drummer for <strong>Redbird Fever</strong>, which soon collapsed, did she suspect that she would end up helping him find a whole new band, in which she herself would be a member?Â  <strong>Best F-Tigers Forever</strong> inherits several of the qualities that drew me to Redbird Fever.Â  Emotionally honest to the point of extreme awkwardness, Best F-Tigers Forever wins us over by simply being themselves.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hogaboomâ€™s</strong> new compositions are more straightforward than the old ones, forgoing complexity for the sake of coherence, yet never sacrificing the characteristic playfulness.Â  The addition of bassâ€”whose intentional absence marked Redbird Feverâ€”provides a more stable foundation that roots the uncensored gush of emotion that, otherwise, could spin out of control.Â  Meanwhile,Â <strong>Clarkâ€™s</strong> beatsâ€”energetic and often a hair ahead of timeâ€”create the illusion of acceleration while, in fact, cementing the groove.Â  Itâ€™s this unlikely balance that allows the listener to sense purpose and direction in the sublime sighs of tenderness that dot the EP, and reminds us to catch our breath in anticipation of the next euphoric eruption of dance.Â  We feel this most viscerally in<strong> A-Side â€œApostrophes,â€ </strong>an anthem that epitomizes the â€˜emotionalâ€™ in emoâ€”minus the obnoxious whining and self-righteous depression.Â  Itâ€™s a well constructed composition with a catchy and convincing sense of urgency that pervades the highs and lows alike.Â  The most obvious focal point of the music, nevertheless, remains Hogaboomâ€™s voice or, more precisely, his vocal style.Â  His unusual and awkward lyrics careen up and down the register in flamboyant arpeggios, sometimes escaping in hiccoughs of passionate yelps.Â  I would call it operatic, but that label wouldnâ€™t do it justiceâ€”while Hogaboomâ€™s vocals clearly draw upon operatic archetypes, they resemble more closely the mock-opereratic yodeling that most of us would only dare to attempt in the shower, when weâ€™re sure nobody is listening.Â  If Hogaboomâ€™s â€˜money notesâ€™ wind up a shade flat (and believe me, they do) it only makes them more sincere.Â  InÂ <strong>B-Side â€œI Will Carve,â€</strong> Hogaboom and Aikens share the mic in alternating verses that hint at conversation, often overlapping, and sometimes aligning in unexpected but satisfying blips of unison.\r\n\r\n<strong>Best F-Tigers Forever</strong> exudes an optimism rare in indie rockâ€”a love for life that I find both unusually sincere and thoroughly refreshing.Â  That said, the music does not shy away from darker themes.Â  â€œ<em>I've been told [<strong>B-Side â€œI Will Carveâ€</strong>] is about cutting,</em>â€ explains <strong>Hogaboom</strong>.Â  â€œ<em>I don't think it is; not for me. To me, it's about the fear of losing someone</em>,â€â€”a theme he deems â€œ<em>less violent, but more sad.â€</em> Whatever the song means to you, the striking part is the artistâ€™s ability to find hope and strength in sadness.Â  The lyrics weave an extended metaphor about sewing that Hogaboom relates to his wife.Â  Â â€œ<em>She creates these things, and they're all personal. They're an extension of herself,â€ </em>he explains.Â  And yet, these elaborate works of art that she creates with a needle, thread, and fabric, are not permanent.Â Â <em>â€œIt's just this object that can be cut, torn, sewn up, worn, used, even sold or thrown away.Â  And I think that's a really interesting way of looking at relationships. We can put care into it, hours of work over fine details that aren't visible to someone else. And when someone leaves you, the thread in that relationship just comes apart, the relationship as clothing just starts falling apart. All the pieces, you might as well just cut them up and throw them away, because the garment is no longer good without that thread.Â â€œ</em>\r\n\r\nWhen <strong>Hogaboom</strong> shared these thoughts with me, I wondered whether he was talking about relationships or bands.Â  He admitted that it could be both and, besides, perhaps the line behind the two isnâ€™t so clear.Â  He probably felt a bit of that when <strong>Redbird Fever</strong> parted ways.Â  Iâ€™ve certainly felt a bit of that every time one of the bands Iâ€™ve worked so hard to build collapsed.Â  But these miniature catastrophes are what, in the long run, fuel artistic evolution and, in the short run, force us not to take our work to seriously.Â  However fragile the band may be, <strong>Best F-Tigers Forever </strong>manages to remain hopefully rooted in the moment.Â  â€œ<em>Redbird Fever took itself seriouslyâ€¦ BFTF is out for a good time, mostly. Oh, we can whine about love lost too, but I think we're subconsciously setting up each song for a party moment.â€</em> After all, this is coming from a band goofy enough to call itself Best F-Tigers Forever.Â  What does the F stand for?Â  â€œ<em>The F is for Friends,â€</em> Iâ€™ve been told<em>.Â  â€œIf you were thinking the other common F abbreviation, well, I'm going to tell your mother you were thinking that.Â  It's Best F-Tigers Forever, because Best Friends Forever was already taken.â€</em> Forget the commercial or artistic ambitions that fuel most bandsâ€”Hogaboom pitched Best F-Tigers to me as the hottest new indie band â€œ<em>sweeping the kitchen sink.â€</em> Within this pun so stupid it could have come from a high-school jazz band director, we may glimpse the self-fulfilling semblance of truth.Â  Nobodyâ€™s pretending to be hip here.Â Â I have my suspicions, though, that the band was aware of the other abbreviation (go ahead, tell my mom, I dare you!) and that any claims to the contrary are just them â€˜friendingâ€™ around with us.Â  Thatâ€™s part of the act.\r\n\r\nAfter centuries of philosophy, psychology, sociology, and biology, we still havenâ€™t managed to find the perfect algorithm for human taste.Â  Nobody can adequately explain what we like and why we like it and, even less fruitful, have been the efforts to forecast our preferences.Â  I donâ€™t like carrots and Iâ€™m not generally fond of cakes, so why is it that I like carrot cake?Â  Explain that one, consumer research!Â  But really, we should be thankful for this inexplicable enigma of taste, without which all we who attempt to make a living through creativity would inevitably lose our jobs to computers.\r\n\r\nGeeky, awkward, unpolished, and down-to-earth, <strong>Best F-Tigers Forever</strong> represents a series of inputs that any computer program would have dismissed as a recipe for failure yet we find ourselves seduced by the personal touches on the recordings and being to root root root for the careers of these underground underdogs.Â  Because, however much we may wish to think of ourselves as logical beings, we so often find ourselves swayed by the mysterious pull of pathosâ€¦ Â Because, however much we may wish that all bands started out with a hitching hairstylist, the regrettable truth is that it perhaps no other band ever has begun that way.Â  If such foundations are entirely too whimsical to believe in, the more we need to believe.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Apostrophes [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM143 Best F-Tigers Forever/01 Apostrophes.mp3|titles=Apostrophes|artists=Best F-Tigers Forever]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - If You Go I Will Carve [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM143 Best F-Tigers Forever/02 If You Go I Will Carve.mp3|titles=If You Go I Will Carve|artists=Best F-Tigers Forever]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM143 Best F-Tigers Forever.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

Fewer still have the vocal dynamo to perform them.  Those who've got both belong to a rare breed.  The determined listener may spend years staggering from coffee house to dive bar, politely stomaching innumerable watered-down one-drink-minimums over comparably watered-down performances in search of one of these elusive artists in its natural habitatâ€”pristine obscurity, untainted by modern ills like inflated ego, commercial aspiration, and mainstream press.  We dream. We console ourselves with the blind hope that such an artist must exist somewhere out there and believe that, when we find it, weâ€™ll recognize it at once.\r\n\r\nI met <strong>Michael Glines</strong> almost two years ago.  Through mutual friends, he wound up sitting in with my street jazz band during one of our weekly all-night jams in Hongdae, the vibrant and usually shit-faced epicenter of Seoulâ€™s music and party scene.  He arrived with just a violin, an instrument heâ€™d just begun to learn, and spent most of the night on the fringes of our makeshift stage.   The few notes he played were buried behind the clamor of drums, amplified guitars, automobiles, and the thick dance grooves that wafted up from the bowls of all the clubs on the block.   In short, it took me a while to recognize Glines as a member of that rare breed of superlative artist.  Near dawn, when the rest of the band had laid down our instruments and diverted our attention to the beers weâ€™d been nursing or striking up conversations with some cute girl in the audience, I noticed Glines, perhaps on request of one such cute girl, break into an original composition.  Strumming his violin (since he hadnâ€™t brought a guitar) and shouting the words to a composition heâ€™d just written (in a language heâ€™d just learned) into the neon night, the performer seized my complete attention.  The crowd looked on in passive approval but I felt that I was witnessing something special.\r\n\r\nOver the next months, I became better acquainted with Glines.  We met a couple of times to share and critique original compositions.  What Glines had mastered was drama.  His compositions all spiraled into lush dissonances, propped up by  confident vocals which he could bend or sustain as much as needed.\r\n\r\nSince then, Glines has returned to his native Califorina, where he's just released a stunning EP, which heâ€™s generously agreed to share with the Ampeater community.  We plan to feature two of these tracks in an upcoming 7â€, but felt that the music was too good to keep to ourselves until then, so here it is:\r\n\r\n[soundcloud url=\"http://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/2109076\" width=\"708\" iframe=\"true\" /]\r\n\r\n\r\nGlines will spend the next few weeks in New York, with a couple of solo performances scheduled.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l/LAQERywMaAQGS_VCOs7B9KtHnz3iPsDLQxJJojmo72p1Ggg/www.leftfieldbar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Thursday July 19, 7pm-11pm @ the Left Field Bar, 87 Ludlow Street, New York, 10002</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l/LAQERywMaAQGS_VCOs7B9KtHnz3iPsDLQxJJojmo72p1Ggg/www.leftfieldbar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Thursday July 26, 7pm-11pm @ the Left Field Bar, 87 Ludlow Street, New York, 10002\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nCatch a remarkable performer while you can, before he leaves town!

As a 10 year old, this was my first full introduction to the most popular musical group in history. Now, this wouldn't normally have been too strange an occurrence, except for the fact that the 6 CD box set featured demo versions and outtakes from throughout the Beatles catalog while altogether omitting the official studio renditions. This has left me permanently impaired during singalongs of Rocky Raccoon, in which I habitually repeat Paul's misspoken line, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY1RB-z6OzI\" target=\"_blank\">\"the doctor walked in, sminking of gin\"</a> and other lyrical oddities. If this is the worst handicap I have in life, I think I'll manage. But what strikes me about the anthologies on repeat listens is the rather odd decision to re-record several John Lennon demos with the surviving Beatles adding new takes atop the original guitar and vocals. It's a process that while interesting comes across as a bit cold and artificial, like the 3D hologram of Tupac at Coachella. It seems an unnatural union, and something that might have been better off confined to \"what if\" chatter around the coffee machine at George Martin's studio. Until last week, I thought it impossible that this process could create music that's not only passable but in many ways superior to the original recordings.\r\n\r\n<strong>Markleford Friedman</strong> is the not-so-silent partner in <strong>The James Rocket</strong>, an unusual collaboration with perennial Ampeater favorite <strong>James William Roy </strong>(<a href=\"/aem103\" target=\"_blank\">AEM103</a>, <a href=\"/aem015\" target=\"_blank\">AEM015</a>). After seeing JWR play live with A Bunch of Girls, he dove into the extensive catalog of JWR demo singles, reveling in a trove of undiscovered nuggets. I think many of us have had that experience with one artist or another, that eye opening moment in which you connect so deeply with a musician that even his scrappy ideas for songs sound better than anything on the radio. What makes Markleford Friedman different is that he had the skills and inclination to do something with the wealth of material that JWR continues to produce. Markleford's background in music (jazz piano and trombone) and electrical engineering (with an emphasis on recording engineering) gave him the tools to make music, but little inclination to develop his own unique voice. Competent in a multitude of instruments, he recorded modest pop songs for his own enjoyment while working as a programmer at a music software company. When he met JWR, a plan began to form. Markleford saw a purpose and a future in crafting the primitive genius of JWR's demos into something he could introduce to the world.\r\n\r\nThe two began to collaborate, and an album took shape. <strong>Markleford</strong> handed over a wishlist of songs for <strong>JWR </strong>to salvage from the original session archives, who in turn remarked on the choices, <em>\"That kind of sounds like a record\"</em>. And so it became. But whose record is it? The songs belong to JWR, but the album has Markleford's fingerprints embedded so deeply that you can practically feel them on the jewel case, like palms pressed into wet cement.  The original tracks came with session detritus--unused takes, discarded ideas, and verses that never made it to the mixing table. Like the eponymously named Minutemen, JWR has a penchant for short songs, often slamming listeners with just a single verse chorus verse before moving on to the next idea. That's all fine and good for an eccentric tunesmith, but Markleford saw a larger vision for JWR's songs. <em>\"There's an honest troubadour quality to what he does,\"</em> Markleford explained over the phone, <em>\"and making a proper album was just the right thing to do\"</em>. When Lars Ulrich threw a tantrum during the Napster debacle, he went nationwide the the idea that (and I paraphrase), <em>\"You can't expect musicians to do this for free\"</em>. To many of us (musicians included), it was a surprise that anyone would proclaim such heresy. Markleford remembers feeling stunned, <em>\"It's what you're driven to do as a musician, whether there's money involved or not. And for most of us there's absolutely no hope of ever making money at it. But it's in your blood. You simply cannot *not* make music. I couldn't believe that he said that.\"</em> This is the sentiment, the drive to create, that brought Markleford's skills as a producer and musician together with JWR's talents as a songwriter. The two compliment each other tremendously, though the nature of their working relationship is anything other than ordinary.\r\n\r\nLike the Beatles working with the ghost of John Lennon, <strong>Markleford</strong> took songs by the very much still extant <strong>JWR</strong> and with his blessing began polishing them, lengthening them, and coaxing out a layer of melodies and harmonies that lay buried under the muck. He added additional guitar, vocals, drums, and other auxiliary parts. He mixed and matched parts from demo renditions of songs to lengthen the originals, even going so far as to add entire guitar solos, as in the case of the album's standout single <strong>\"Paper Valentines\"</strong>. The album was mixed and mastered over several months, during the course of which it was declared \"done\" several times, only to be exhumed for additional tweaking and improvements. The overarching theory became <em>\"how can we make this lighter and tighter?\"</em>--a sometimes herculean task given the Pollard-inspired aesthetic of JWR's original demos. But Markleford approached his numerous musical refinements with a goal to enrich the original tunes, and to reach a balance in which the songs speak more clearly in their final polished version than they ever did in demo form. The results are astounding, and what began as a superfan's dream soon grew into a genuine partnership, in which Markleford's attention to detail and borderline obsessive tendencies serve to temper JWR's sloppier inclinations. Eventually Markleford grew bold, and asked himself <em>\"If I were to make my own perfect JWR album, what would it sound like?\"</em> At the end of the day, after months of meticulous work, the final result is the album <strong>Launch</strong>, which is being released today, and is available for sale on the Ampeater store in MP3 form. In honor of this new collaboration, we're proud to present a follow-up single for free streaming and download.

It's amazing to open something up with your hands and put it on a turntable or CD player. We don't do that often enough anymore. Ampeater darlings <strong>Plume Giant </strong>sent us a pre-release copy of their album <em>Callithump</em>, scheduled for release on August 28th. While we can't blow the big surprise by leaking the music, we can tell you that they'll be ushering in the new record with a <a href=\"http://www.mercuryloungenyc.com/event/142541/\" target=\"_blank\">show at Mercury Lounge on August 31st</a>. If you've seen the videos from their <a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/plume-giant-the-sprague-hall-sessions-complete-audio\">Sprague Hall sessions,</a> you'd be remiss to let this one slide by.

We like to ruminate on each review and allow ourselves to digress into abstract philosophical speculations, conversations with ourselves, grandiose cinematic fantasies, obscure biographical anecdotes, metaphors cloaked in metaphors, and even confessions about our troubled personal lives.  Sometimes, we manage to weave these disparate threads together into a coherent and profound reflection on the music.  Regardless, we manage to have fun.\r\n\r\nBut, we also realize that less can be more.  The world craves reduced calories, thinner phones, lower taxes, slimmer waistlines, etc.  Thus, weâ€™ve decided to supplement our traditional features with a new release formatâ€”the Ampeater Snapshot Series. \r\n\r\nThe Ampeater Snapshot Series will provide a concise and articulate glimpse into each featured artist, without all the extra pontification.  Each release will include one track, one photo, under a hundred words from the artist, and under two hundred words from us.  We plan to keep it simple, and hopefully fresh!  The series will enable us to better accommodate our large volume of submissions from talented artists and to offer our readership a steady dose of new music.  \r\n\r\nThe Ampeater Snapshot will be a regular component of the site, with a new artist featured every Monday.  Tune in for the first installment, Monday, December 3rd!\r\n</div>",

But after the low-bitrate drumbeat crunch gets swept up in a vortex of lush arpeggios, weâ€™re reminded that the heaviest drugs arenâ€™t always amphetamines and can creep up on you throughout the trip.  While this track isnâ€™t quite sure whether it wants to be an upper, downer, or hallucinogen, it has an undeniable power to destabilize and to draw the listener outside of the normal world.\r\n\r\nPassenger Peruâ€™s self-titled debut demonstrates exceptional attention to composition and structure.  Most tracks revolve around several distinct themes, which the band rehashes or piles together to create a sense of progress.  The product is full of intrigue and surprise, but it seldom comes across as random.  Passenger Peruâ€™s compositions feel somehow scientific in their approach, with each unexpected turn premeditated and even engineered.  Itâ€™s a formula that works well for an artist whose chief concern seems to be the washout of genuine emotion in a digital world.  Passenger Peru offers a bleak glimpse of a dystopian present, through which Stiverâ€™s smooth and distant voice whispers to the drugged listener that it might be time to sober up.\r\n\r\n<strong>IN THE ARTISTâ€™S WORDS</strong>\r\nPassenger Peru was born out of necessity: the necessity to be creative in a rapidly uncreative world, the necessity to make music we want to hear, the necessity to live.  And we find it very necessary (like Salt-n-Pepa) to do everything ourselves, from recording to mixing to the promotion and release of our music.  Maybe it's because we're inspired by the likes of Fugazi and Deerhoof and want to have total control of all our output, or maybe we don't want to owe anything to anyone other than ourselves.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Heavy Drugs [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/Snap_PassengerPeru/Heavy Drugs.mp3|titles=Heavy Drugs|artists=Passenger Peru]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",

Recorded & mixed at\r\nFuzzy Rainbow Studios [New Haven, CT].\r\n\r\n<strong>IN AMPEATERâ€™S WORDS</strong>\r\nEULA knows just when to offer the audience a lollipop and when to slap it in the face.  Often, the artist manages to do both at the same time.  Alyse Lambâ€™s soft soprano vocals can come across as cute, but with an undeniable undercurrent of sarcasm.  Sheâ€™s like the devious kid sister who melted your legos in her easybake oven or folded your baseball cards into paper cranes, but somehow managed to shed enough fake tears to evade punishment.  Lambâ€™s voice is beautiful, and a little bit cruel.  With spastic rhythms and appropriate levels of distortion, the instrumentals tap into the fuck-you sentiment of vintage punk and thrash but without so much anger. Instead, the music veers into bursts of danceable euphoria.  The minimalist three-piece formation helps to avoid the clutter that could otherwise ensue, and allows each instrument or voice to stand out in the mix.  Still, EULA reminds us that it doesnâ€™t take a large band to create a lot of noise.  â€œMaurice Narcisse,â€ leaves no doubt that the artist has a good time on stage, and ends each show with a smile and no remorse for the blown-out sound systems left behind.\r\n\r\n<strong>IN THE ARTISTâ€™S WORDS</strong>\r\nSo sticky, so nutty, so heavyâ€¦ mashed against a wall of sweet gelatinous gooeynessâ€¦. slammed in between 2 wholesome pieces of softness... the roof of your mouth is a little shredded from the peanuts and the jelly is slipping down your chin but you canâ€™t stop taking bites of that sandwich.

In Whales / The Magic of Multiples, multi-instrumentalist Alex Drum gives his compositions free range to do just that.  As a studio project, Whales feels removed from the pressures of performance.  With no need to cement that new tune before the next show, Drum has time on his side.  For many studio projects, this liberation can become a curse because it strips music of its communicative power.  Without an audience, music ceases to be an exchange and tends to lose its vitality.  However, in the case of Whales, itâ€™s clear that Drum has assumed the roles of both artist and audience.  Intimate and reflective, the music feels like an artistâ€™s conversation with himself.   â€œStrong Female Leadsâ€ was subjected to ample rumination, forgotten and rediscovered in the course of its gradual maturation. The result is a superlative composition, full of nuances but also raw power in moments like the unexpected (but in retrospect, inevitable) explosion when the beat drops and the promised female vocals finally emerge.  Whales is an artist on the verge of discovery, constantly surprised by the beauty it manages to unearth from within.\r\n\r\n<strong>IN THE ARTISTâ€™S WORDS</strong>\r\nWell I work at a snails pace. I play/record everything myself and the majority of the time i'm writing the parts as i'm recording. I'll record 5 minutes of a guitar line or loop, file it away and move onto something else. So alot of the songs end up spanning months and sometimes even years and end up becoming collages of sorts. Not the most efficient way to go about the song writing process but it works for me.\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Strong Female Leads [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/Snap_Whales/Strong Female Leads.mp3|titles=Strong Female Leads|artists=Whales]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",

The band embraces the indie aesthetic but goes about it via a classical approach.  Each track is a masterpieceâ€”pleasant to the ear and innovative to the intellectâ€”full of compositional grace and orchestral balance.\r\n\r\nâ€œTransitâ€ begins with a smooth vocal verse and a melodic guitar hook. While these sections alone could have alone made a complete and credible indie tune, Peaks gives us more than expected and digresses into a 6/8 jazz-waltz through which a saxophone and other unconventional textures provide a rich harmonic backdrop for the impromptu choir that emerges.  After a well-timed climax, the track eases into a final verse, which soon crumbles as the drums somersault\r\ninto a fireworks display of rolls and fills.  In the midst of the chaos, the ensemble comes together in unison to deliver a final resolute rendition of the main theme.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, throughout the stark metamorphosis, the music never ceases to be subtle.  Unexpected twists that would seem contrived in the hands of amateurs are executed with such nonchalant precision that the daredevil compositional risks undertaken donâ€™t distract.  In short, Peaks is no less than the realization of indie as an artform.\r\n\r\n<strong>TRACK TITLE:</strong> Transit\r\n\r\n<strong>TRACK PERSONNEL:</strong>\r\nRachel Ishikawa â€“ Composition, Guitar, Vocals\r\nPeter Hartmann â€“ Guitar, Keyboards, Vocals\r\nNate Mendelsohn â€“ Guitar, Bass, Saxophone\r\nTom Kearney â€“ Guitar, Electronics, Mastering\r\nDuncan Standish â€“ Drums, Percussion\r\n\r\n<strong>IN THE ARTISTâ€™S WORDS</strong>\r\n\"Transit is simultaneously simple and strange.  It sports a sugary melody and a poppy groove, but has a strange form, with a wordless chorus, a far away waltz for a bridge, and a free-jazz clatter of a finale. Rachel says it tracks a romance turned long distance, from a train-ride away relationship to a plane-ride away one, but it reminds the rest of us of the late, snowy night in Massachusetts when we recorded it.  It is a rumbling, restless journey, disguised as a pop song, or perhaps the opposite.\"\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Transit [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/Snap_Peaks/Transit.mp3|titles=Transit|artists=Peaks]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",

Three of the band's albums have reached Top-10 on the Irish Pop Charts. Delorentos has also been nominated for notable accolades like the Choice Music Prize and Meteor Awards. The attention is well deserved. Delorentos knows how to write immediate and memorable songs like the two tracks featured here. <em>Little Sparks</em>, the band's latest album from which both featured tracks are drawn, will no-doubt appeal to the mainstream. Still, Delorentos hasn't lost touch with its indie heritage and sold its soul. In fact, grassroots tactics continue to pave the band's path into the spotlight. Independent artists around the world should take careful note of Delorentos, and for more reasons than the music alone. Delorentos demonstrates a viable formula for homemade success and presents hope for reconciliation between underground and main-stream aesthetics and approaches in the era of digital music.\r\n\r\n<strong>A-Side â€œBullet In A Gunâ€</strong> is the obvious breakthrough single on <em>Little Sparks</em>. <strong>Delorentos</strong> builds a spectacular anthem on a modest and overused chord progression through one of the catchiest melodies ever unleashed upon the human race. Ro's intense performance creates seems all the more urgent and desperate because it is so exposed. Tension mounts throughout the verse and then explodes in the chorus. It's not a matter of volume or complex orchestration, though. We can feel the power of the composition even in an unplugged arrangement like the one performed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Spzl8NjqSeQ\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The video was shot on a narrow cobblestone street in historic Madrid. Delorentos had planned to perform a different track, but made an impromptu decision to switch when the audience requested a new track. <em>â€œWith an hour to go we hadn't worked out a version,â€</em> explains Kieran. Without a formal arrangement, amplification, or proper instruments, the track still sounds huge. Vocal harmonies and raw percussion give it the needed lift. The track retains a deep a visceral rhythmic pulse that, whether present or just implied, propels it from start to finish. The contrast between the solo verse and collective chorus also emphasizes the lyrical shift from the individual to universal.\r\n\r\n<strong>B-Side â€œPetarduâ€</strong> represents a more reflective side of <strong>Delorentos</strong>. The discrete catchiness hinges on ambiance, with lusher textures and smoother production. The vocals are gorgeous and retain a relaxed pace appropriate over the more energetic beat. As a whole, the track is introspective and bittersweet.\r\n\r\n<strong>Delorentos</strong> released <em>Little Sparks</em> under its own label, <strong>Delorecords.</strong> To celebrate and promote the album, Delorentos put new spin on a traditional approach. The band visited cities and towns throughout the nation to make new friends and fans through intimate acoustic concerts in makeshift venues. Most of the record shops where such events would have been hosted in the past have closed down, so instead the band created its own flash Deloshops. <em>â€œIt was a great success, and we actually sold some CDs too!â€ </em>jokes Kieran. <em>â€œI think if you want to be in a band, and expect people to listen to your music, you need to write great music, play great shows and do interesting things!â€</em> The band also accompanied the release with a homemade magazine dedicated to some of their favorite artists throughout Ireland. From a band with such mass appeal, grassroots touches like these represent a sincere and admirable commitment to establishing a personal connection with an ever growing fanbase.\r\n\r\nAll members of <strong>Delorentos</strong> are singers and songwriters who share the role of frontman and contribute to the collective composition process. After almost a decade of experience together, the band seems to have discovered a comfortable and productive balance. Little Sparks retains the energetic optimism that marked the bands earlier work but with a more mature polish and artistic vision.\r\n\r\n<strong>Delorentos</strong> has begun to make the leap across the Atlantic, with visits to SXSW and CMW. The band plans to return again to perform in more festivals soon. In addition to the infectious music, the accents might help it earn love. On a deeper level, Delorentos seems to tap into the rich music heritage of its home. The music retains the direct and cathartic homespun vibe of Irish Folk. Or perhaps its just wistful speculation. Regardless, American audiences will no-doubt find much to adore in Delorentos. Through no diamond-in-the-rough, Delorentos seems destined for attention on a wider scale than it has so far achieved.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sidea.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side A - Bullet In A Gun [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM144 Delorentos/01 Bullet In A Gun.mp3|titles=Bullet In A Gun|artists=Delorentos]</td>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/sideb.png);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>Side B - Petardu [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/AEM144 Delorentos/02 Petardu.mp3|titles=Petardu|artists=Delorentos]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4 style=\"clear: both; padding-top: 20px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/audio1/AEM144 Delorentos.zip\">[[[Download the 7-inch]]]</a></h4>\r\n</div>",

This was maybe a decade ago. I can't remember who was in the car. I think it was the night we went to the diner we liked and found it was closed for good. Maybe not. Years later I spent all my money and went to Texas, but it didn't change anything. I remember a story about two people leaving an evil chair on the front lawn. I used to think it was good to hang on to your memories but now I don't feel the same.\r\n\r\n<strong>In Ampeater's words:</strong>\r\nWar Mothers is a difficult artist to review because its music is so personal and its approach so counter-intuitive. The minimalist folk-pop due defies convenient labels and challenges us to reconsider our reflexive definitions of what it means to be in a band. No website. No Facebook. War Mothers forces listeners to approach its music on their own terms, free from preconceptions. No artifical image. No bullshit. The artist shares its personal email address and invites direct contact from intregued listeners. So feel free to jump straight to the music. The words that follow express no more than the author's personal impressions.\r\n\r\nWar Mothers strikes an ideal balance between singer-songwriter and band. The music includes bursts of lush orchestration but remains rooted in the vocal melodies. Dylan SP's expressive voice and wide dynamic range have earned him the obvious comparisons to Jeff Buckley. Like Buckley, Dylan can jump from plaintive whisper to soulful wail to angelic falsetto with expert precision and no hesitation. The unhurried pace of these gorgeous compositions underscores these dynamic shifts. At the softest moments, the accompaniment is sparse. The delicate strum of an acoustic guitar is the sole harmonic support on the first section of \"I Wish You Were A Monster.\" However, the track derives crucial force from the efforts of Barrett Lindgren. Additional layers of texture like the trill of banjo of the dark thud of contrabass swell up to accentuate dramatic moments throughout the compositions, but never take the foreground. War Mothers knows the proper value of peace and quiet. The artist's brilliance is most evident not in the notes played but in the pauses between notes.\r\n\r\nIt's no surprise that the artist began on a midnight drive. War Mothers provides the perfect soundtrack to space out to on a dark road, when all the other passengers are fast alseep and time slows to a drip, delineated only by the gradual tick of freeway exits leading nowhere.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Nate Greenberg</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>I Wish You Were A Monster [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/Snap_WarMothers/I Wish You Were A Monster.mp3|titles=I Wish You Were A Monster|artists=War Mothers]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",

Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m after, thatâ€™s what singing and playing the electric guitar and droning on and on can give to me and, I hope, to you, too. I hope that we can be suspended together in the same warm syrup of human kindness that so moves me, at least until the tape runs out.\r\n\r\n<strong>In Ampeater's words:</strong>\r\nBen Seretan tells me that featured track \"My One True Love\" is the closest thing he has to a single. He's probably right. The track is certainly the closest approximation of a single on his latest album, ironically titled,\"New Song.\" In some respects, the album functions as a single song, a congruent whole, or at least, an untanglable knot of something vaguely resembling music. Seretan tends to write hypnotic drone-based compositions that deliberately hijack the listener's space-time continuum. The last time we featured him was for a trippy multimedia project inspired by hummingbirds. So, it's all relative. \"My One True Love\" falls short of accessible, but at least it's penetrable, insofar as it clocks in at a conventional four minutes and includes vocals and a vague sense of rhythm. Still the words tend to get drowned out by the kaleidoscopic of folkish guitar, and the rhythm grinds to a halt whenever it starts to build too much momentum. Seretan composed \"New Song\" during a residency in rural Upstate New York. Over the course of the album, we can feel him gradually reject the mechanical pulse of urban existance and tune into the pulse of nature. Seretan explains that the album was inspired by a sensation of \"living in multiple time periods at once (the feeling of talking on a cell phone in a field unchanged for centuries, using a language that is new but somehow remembered), the guitar as if it grew out of the earth like a root vegetable, my voice like it fell sun ripened from a tree.â€ Seretan's music develops on a geological timescale. Like continental drift, the evolution is too gradual to notice in the moment but, from afar, the implications are profound and irreversible. You may struggle and fail to make sense of what you hear, but you'll probably stumble across a moment of zen in the process.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"http://ampeatermusic.com/?tag=nate-greenberg\">Nate GreenÂ­berg</a></p>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"background: no-repeat url(http://ampeatermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/record.jpg);\" width=\"80px\"></td>\r\n<td>My One True Love [audio:http://www.ampeatermusic.com/audio1/Snap_BenSeretan/My One True Love.mp3|titles=My One True Love|artists=Ben Seretan]</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",
